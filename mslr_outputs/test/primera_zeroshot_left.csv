0,CD000024,"[Prevention of deep venous thrombosis of the leg by a very low molecular weight heparin fraction (CY 222) in patients with hemiplegia following cerebral infarction: a randomized pilot study (30 patients)]. The effectiveness and safety of a very low molecular weight heparin fraction were evaluated in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis in patients confined to bed due to hemiplegia consecutive to a recent cerebral infarction. CY 222 was administered within 48 hours of the stroke by one single daily subcutaneous injection of 0.6 ml (= 15,000 U AXa IC) during 14 days. The effects of CY 222 were assessed in a group of 15 patients compared with a control group of 15 untreated patients. No deep-vein thrombosis was detected by the labelled fibrinogen test in the treated group, as against 12 patients in the control group. At post-mortem, 9.9% of the strokes were haemorrhagic (4 in the treatment and 3 in the control group). Low-dose calcium heparin given subcutaneously following acute stroke reduced the number of deep-vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli and deaths without increasing the"
1,CD000074,"The two infants who initially responded to placebo remained responsive for the duration of the study. Of the eight infants in whom treatment with placebo failed, five were randomly assigned to receive theophylline, for a total of 15 infants treated with theophylline, and two of the eight were randomly assigned to receive doxapram, for a total of 13 infants treated with doxapram; the remaining infant required tracheal intubation. Of the 15 infants randomly assigned to receive theophylline, seven responded for the duration of the study; of the eight infants who did not respond to treatment with theophylline, five responded to doxapram, one responded to a combination of theophylline and doxapram, and two remained resistant to treatment. Of the 13 infants randomly assigned to receive doxapram four responded for the duration of the study; of the nine who did not respond to doxapram, seven responded to theophylline, one responded to a combination of theophylline and doxapram, and one remained resistant to treatment.."
2,CD000116,"Previous studies indicate that analysis of the ST waveform of the fetal electrocardiogram provides information on the fetal response to hypoxia. We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that intrapartum monitoring with cardiotocography combined with automatic ST-waveform analysis results in an improved perinatal outcome compared with cardiotocography alone. At three Swedish labour wards, 4966 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labour after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal cardiotocography. There was a trend towards fewer operative interventions for presumed fetal distress in the time-interval analysis plus cardiotocography group (63 [13%] vs 78 [16%]), but this was not significant (relative risk 0.80 [95% CI 0.59-1.08], p=0.17). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of babies who had an umbilical arterial pH of 7.15 or less (51 [11%] vs 49 [11%]; 1.01 [0.7-1.47]), or in the frequency of unsuspected acidaemia (42 [9%] vs 35 ["

A series of 80 patients with cervical, trochanteric or subtrochanteric hip fractures were randomized to either treatment without traction, skin traction, or skeletal traction during the 1883 h between admission and operation. The institution of skin or skeletal traction was not particularly painful for the patient, but we found no indication that either was of discernible benefit. The number of analgesic medications needed was no higher in patients without traction.. Preoperative skin traction for hip fracture: a randomized comparison between skin and skeletal traction in 78 patients. 153 consecutive patients with displaced cervical and trochanteric hip fractures were considered for inclusion in this study. 75 were excluded because of senile confusion and the remaining 78 were randomized to skeletal or skin traction preoperatively. The effect on pain alleviation was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and by the number of doses of analgesics administered. The processing time through the emergency department, radiographic department and to the ward, as well as time to operation, was registered. No significant difference in the VAS pain evaluation was found. There was a small significant increase in consumption of analgesics of no clinical importance in patients with skin traction, and"

11,CD000255,"Spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery The role of Doppler/Duplex studies and conservative management. Cervical internal carotid dissection is not rare. Doppler ultrasound screening of young patients presenting with stroke, identified 10 patients with reduced common and internal carotid blood flow without any evidence of atheroma. Eight, on angiography proved to have a dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery. All were managed conservatively. Seven received anticoagulant therapy, stopping any further neurological symptoms. In the absence of iatrogenic side effects, both anticoagulation and antiplatelets seem to be safe for eICAD. The rates for death and stroke were low and outcome ratings did not differ between both agents.

Treatment was continued for two weeks. In the placebo group, 12 of 25 patients developed a deep venous thrombosis and in five of these patients the thrombosis propagated to the thigh. There were no deep venous thromboses in the heparin-treated group during the two weeks of treatment, but four patients developed a deep venous thrombosis within a week of stopping the heparin. The heparin regime was safe; operative blood loss was not increased, nor was there an increased incidence of wound complications as compared to the placebo group. in the arthroplasty group with a combination of pulmonary X-ray and perfusion scintigraphy. The frequency of thrombosis was significantly higher in untreated hip fracture patients than in untreated arthroplasty patients. In hip fracture patients both treatments significantly reduced the frequency of thrombosis. Only dextran reduced the frequency of major thrombosis and in the heparin group one fatal pulmonary embolism occurred. After elective hip surgery the overall frequency"

22,CD000479,"The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of varicocelectomy with that of clomiphene citrate on seminal improvement and pregnancy rates in patients with subclinical varicocele. A total of 42 infertile men with left subclinical varicocele were randomized to group I (21 patients, surgery) and group II (21 patients, medical therapy). The patients in group I were treated with varicocelectomy and those in group II with clomiphene citrate, 50 mg/day, orally. Sperm parameters (sperm density, motility and morphology) were recorded before and 6 months after beginning the treatment and pregnancy rates were estimated. In statistical analysis, paired and independent-samples t-tests, Kaplan-Meier and Log rank tests and Fisher's exact test were used. Mean +/- SD age of the series was 32.7 +/- 6.1 years, that of group I was 32.2 +/- 5.5 years and that of group II was 33.1 +/- 6.7 years (P = 0.680).

Thirty hypertensive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were divided randomly into two groups. The treated group was begun on preliminary volume expansion, and control of hypertension was carried out using vasodilators and centrally acting drugs. The control group was treated in the classical manner for hypertension, with a diuretic as the foundation for therapy.. HV patients received significantly more fluid and had higher pulmonary artery diastolic and central venous pressures than NV patients, but there was no effect on net fluid balance or on blood volume measured on the third postoperative day. There was no difference in mean global CBF during the treatment period between HV and NV patients (P=0.55, random-effects model). However, there was also no difference in minimum regional CBF between the 2 treatment groups. HV therapy resulted in increased cardiac filling pressures and fluid intake but did not increase CBF or blood volume compared with NV therapy. Although careful fluid management to avoid hypovolemia may reduce the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia after SAH, prophylactic HV therapy is unlikely to confer an additional benefit"
24,CD000491,Comparison of single dose with a five-day course of trimethoprim for asymptomatic (covert) bacteriuria of pregnancy. Sixty consecutive pregnant women with asymptomatic (covert) bacteriuria detected between 16 and 30 weeks gestation were randomly allocated to treatment with either a single 600 mg dose or a standard five-day course of trimethoprim. Forty-four women received fosfomycin trometamol and 40 women received cefuroxime axetyl. There were no statistically significant differences between both groups regarding the mean age and mean duration of pregnancy. Therapeutic success was achieved in 93.2% of the patients treated with fosfomycin trometamol vs 95% of those treated with cefuroxime axetyl. A single dose of fosfomycin trometamol is a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of asymptomatic urinary tract infections in the second trimester of pregnancy.

No clotting of blood within the grafts or native vessels was noted during the conduct of the surgical procedures in either group. The operative procedure, complication rate, and hospital course were also indistinguishable; patency at 1 month was also equal. Fibrinogen depletion with ancrod provides anticoagulation for the conduct of infrainguinal vascular reconstructions that is as effective as heparin. When heparin is contraindicated ancrod is an effective and safe alternative comparable to unfractionated heparin (UFH) as an anticoagulant during infrainguinal bypass surgery and to investigate laboratory evidence of hypercoagulation in patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery.

After a run in period of six months patients were randomly given the book, the tape, both the book and tape, or neither. Patients' knowledge of the use of drugs, perceptions of their disability, skill in using an inhaler, consumption of drugs, consultations with their general practitioners, morbidity (from patients' entries on diary cards), and use of the educational material were measured. Knowledge about the use of drugs was significantly increased in the groups who received the material after three months and persisted after 12 months. Patients who had been given the tape or the book and tape increased their scores of knowledge of drugs more than patients given the book alone. Patients in all groups given the material considered that their disability was reduced. There were no other significant changes. Patients given both the book and the tape preferred the book. The paradoxical result whereby patients learnt more from the tape but preferred the book suggests that a distinction can be made between information that patients need, which may be acquired better from an audiocassette, and information that they want, which may be acquired better from a book.."

There was no perioperative (30 day) limb loss or death, but five late deaths (late survival rate, 90%). Mean follow-up was 59 months. In the SV group, three bypass grafts failed, requiring repeat operation in only one patient. In the PTFE group, eight bypass grafts failed, leading to five repeat operations. There was no statistically significant difference in primary ""assisted"" patency rate for the two grafts: 100%, 98%, and 94% for SV grafts, and 96%, 84%, and 84% for PTFE grafts (P =.09"

Women with breast cancer were provided with an audiotape of their primary adjuvant treatment consultation, and the following patient outcomes were measured at 12 weeks postconsultation: perceived degree of information provision, audiotape satisfaction and use, communication satisfaction with oncologist, mood state, and cancer-specific quality of life. Participants included 628 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and 40 oncologists from six cancer centers in Canada. The patients were block randomized to one of four consultation groups: standard care control, not audiotaped; audiotaped, no audiotape given; audiotaped, patient given audiotape; and audiotaped, patient offered choice of receiving audiotape or not. Patients receiving the consultation audiotape had significantly better recall of having discussed side effects of treatment than patients who did not receive the audiotape. Audiotape benefit was not significantly related to patient satisfaction with communication, mood state, or quality of life at 12 weeks postconsultation, and was not significantly affected by choice of receiving the audiotape. Patients rated the audiotape intervention positively,"

In a randomized prospective trial, we studied the effect of early high-dose phenobarbital treatment on the early (intraventricular hemorrhage) and late (neurodevelopmental abnormalities) manifestations of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in preterm infants weighing 1500 g or less at birth. The first intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg was given at a mean age of 110 minutes, followed by 15 mg/kg after 4 hours and then by 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals for 5 days. The overall incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was 32% in treated and 46% in control infants, a nonsignificant difference. An ultrasound brain scan at 9 months old revealed no significant difference in the incidence of ventricular dilatation between treated (19%) and control (29%) infants. At 27 months, a similar incidence of mild (10%) and severe (10%) neurodevelopmental handicaps was found in both treated and control groups. Since beneficial effects could not be documented by any of the criteria used, we conclude that routine administration of phenobarbital to low birth weight infants"

This study is undertaken in order to find out (a) whether increasing the dose of nebulized furosemide from 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight will further improve the pulmonary mechanics in premature infants with evolving chronic lung disease and (b) whether the effects of a single dose of nebulized furosemide last beyond 2 hours. The effect of nebulized furosemide on pulmonary mechanics was studied at a mean postnatal age of 24 days (range 14 to 50 days) in 13 premature infants, 24 to 28 weeks' gestational age, who had been dependent on mechanical ventilation since birth. Furosemide was administered by nebulization at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg of body weight, in random order, on two separate days 24 hours apart.

Sertindole is a novel antipsychotic agent with high selectivity for the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway and nanomolar affinities for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2, and norepinephrine NE alpha 1 receptors.. This study assessed time to treatment failure with 24 mg/day sertindole or 10 mg/day haloperidol in 282 clinically stable neuroleptic-responsive outpatients with schizophrenia. During a 5-week transition period, patients were randomized to treatment with sertindole or haloperidol; other treatments were gradually discontinued. Time to treatment failure was numerically superior in sertindole-treated patients compared with haloperidol-treated patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. Sertindole-treated patients, however, remained free of hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia and remained medically compliant significantly longer than did haloperidol-treated patients. In addition, there were significantly fewer reports of EPS in sertindole-treated patients and sertindole therapy was generally well tolerated."

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of low-dose erythromycin on the time taken to attain full enteral feedings in preterm infants with very low birth weight and feeding intolerance. Two groups of preterm infants (birth weight </= 1500 g) with feeding intolerance were randomized to either low-dose erythromycin (5 mg/kg every 8 hours) or 5% dextrose placebo, both of which were discontinued 1 week after full enteral feedings were tolerated. The primary outcome variable was the time taken to attain full enteral feedings of at least 130 mL/kg/d. The gestational age at birth was similar in the two groups (erythromycin, 27.1 +/- 1.9 weeks; placebo, 27.5 +/- 2.9 weeks). The median gestational age, birth weight and postnatal age at start of feeds were significantly shorter and the number of withheld feeds were significantly less in the EM group than the control group; the respective medians (interquartile ranges) were 7 days (6"
73,CD001831,"The results of the study show that in the letosteine treated group there is a statistically significant decrease in fever, a favourable evolution of thoracic objectivity and an improvement in certain respiratory function parameters (MEF 75, PEF). It is concluded that treatment with letosteine leads to a significant increase in the rate of regression of thoracic symptomatology and a faster, more substantial reduction in fever in children suffering from acute bronchitis. This is probably the result of drug action on mucus viscosity, restoring optimal mucociliary clearance, and through action fostering the penetration of antibacterial substances into the mucus as needed for URI symptoms. Two hours after each dose of study medication, changes in the child's runny nose, nasal congestion, cough, and sleep status were assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire. A total of 175 responses were recorded for 59 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in symptom improvement between the ADC and the placebo group (runny nose, p = 0.48; nasal congestion, p = 0.94; cough, p = 0.66). However, the proportion of children asleep 2 hours after receiving the ADC was significantly higher than the proportion receiving placebo (46.6% vs 26."

Thirty-five healthy patients aged 15-36 years scheduled for bilateral tonsillectomy were randomly allocated to receive the following treatments: tonsillar infiltration with 0.25% bupivacaine 5 min before surgical incision (n = 12); identical tonsillar infiltration administered after both tonsils had been surgically removed (n = 12); infiltration with isotonic saline 5 min before the operation (n = 11). There were no significant differences between groups in pain scores (VAS) at rest or during drinking of 100 ml of water as measured at 4 h postoperatively or on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 8th postoperative days. Four, five and three patients in the pre-operative bupivacaine, postoperative bupivacaine, and saline groups, respectively, received one dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1 morphine intravenously (p = 0.76).

75,CD001878,"Two weeks after the last treatment the mean pain index was significantly reduced to 43% in the group treated with manual therapy compared with the pretreatment level. At follow-up five weeks later, the pain index was still lower in this group compared with the group treated with cold packs, but this difference was not statistically significant. The pain index for all 19 patients was significantly correlated to the use of analgesics as well as to the frequency of associated symptoms (number of days per week with dizziness, visual disturbances and ear symptoms). It is concluded that the type of manual therapy used in this study seems to have a specific effect in reducing post-traumatic headache. The result supports the hypothesis of a cervical mechanism causing post-traumatic headache and suggests that post-traumatic dizziness, visual disturbances and ear symptoms could be part of a cervical syndrome.Effectiveness of acupuncture and physiotherapy on myogenic headache: a comparative study. Twenty-two tension-neck and headache patients were divided into acupuncture and physiotherapy groups.

This hypothesis implies that by correction of the deranged amino acid pattern in the blood of cirrhotics, false neurotransmission and then portosystemic encephalopathy is improved. We conducted a double-blind crossover placebo-controlled trial in 22 inpatients with liver cirrhosis and obtained evidence of latent (subclinical) portosystemic encephalopathy using an extensive psychometric test program. Patients received a defined diet of 35 cal/kg X day containing 1 g of protein. In addition, branched chain amino acids or casein in a dosage of 0.25 g/kg X day was administered in a crossover fashion, each for 1 wk. Semiquantitative nitrogen balance increased during both treatments, with a tendency of a larger increase during branched chain amino acid treatment. At the same time ammonia concentration tended to decrease during branched chain amino acid treatment. Taking into account the crossover design, significant improvements attributable to branched chain amino acid treatment could be demonstrated in psychomotor functions (line tracing, tapping, steadiness, auditory reaction time), attention (digit table), and"

Injectable calcitonin is effective in reducing spinal bone loss in steroid-dependent asthma but side effects are frequent. In contrast, a nasal spray presentation has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in involutional osteoporosis. To test the efficacy of nasal calcitonin a two year prospective trial was conducted in 44 steroid-dependent asthmatic patients. All patients received a calcium supplement of 1000 mg and were allocated randomly into two groups treated with either salmon calcitonin nasal spray (200 IU every other day, n = 22) or calcium alone (n = 22) for two years. All patients completed the first year of the study. In the calcitonin group one patient developed generalised pruritus and four lost steroid dependence, and in the calcium alone group five were no longer dependent on steroids.

To determine the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme offered to a general population with 90 days of sick-leave due to non-specific musculoskeletal pain. The results concerning return to work and re-sick-listing during a follow-up period of five years were evaluated for Swedes and immigrants separately. Compared to a control group, the rehabilitation offer resulted in improved work stability after work return among the Swedes. The immigrants, as a group, did not benefit from the programme compared to the controls in primary care. The experimental programs had a significant positive impact on quality of life and self-efficacy. Helplessness, number of days feeling bad, physical dysfunction, and pain in the tender points decreased significantly in one or both of the treated groups when retested 6 weeks after the end of the program. Longterm followup of 67 treated subjects showed significant positive changes on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire primarily in the physical training group.

One hundred thirty-three incontinent women in seven nursing homes were assigned randomly to a 13-week behavior therapy program for urinary incontinence or to a control group that received usual incontinence-related care. The therapy became effective after 6 weeks of training. By the final month of training, the treatment women's wet episodes had been reduced by 0.6 episodes per day, a 26% reduction over baseline. This reduction in the number of wet episodes was statistically significant, both with respect to this group's baseline levels of incontinence and in comparison with the performance of the control women. The number of wet episodes in the control group remained about the same throughout training and the 22-week follow-up period. The treatment women improved partly because they learned to request help, a response prompted and reinforced by the program.

If amenorrhea was not obtained after 1 month of treatment, the gestrinone dose was increased to 2.5 mg three times a week (7 patients) and the danazol dose to 800 mg/day (2 patients). A total of 15 patients from the gestrinone group, including four patients with hirsutism, and 17 patients from the danazol group, including six patients with headache, withdrew because of adverse symptoms. An additional 22 patients, including 10 from the gestrinone group and 12 from the danazol group withdrew because of lack of efficacy, pregnancy, elevated hepatic function tests or for reasons unrelated to the trial. Total American Fertility Society scoring showed an improvement of 73.3% in 101 patients receiving gestrinone and 72.7% in 99 patients receiving danazol. The results showed a significant reduction in the severity of dysmenorrhoea by the third month in the danazol group and at 6 months in both groups. There"

The starting sample consisted of 146 patients receiving low-dose methadone, 142 patients receiving methadyl acetate. Patients were first given 30 mg of both drugs, and doses were incremented by 10 mg/week until they stabilized at methadyl acetate, 80 mg three times a week, and methadone hydrochloride, 50 mg daily or 100 mg daily. Dosage was fixed for the balance of the 40-week treatment period. Safety was evaluated by clinical and laboratory observations conducted at frequent intervals throughout the study. Objective and subjective measures of efficacy (urine toxicology, retention, craving, and withdrawal symptoms) were examined at the study midpoint and at termination, and safety data were tabulated over the entire 52-week study period. Patients assigned to high-dose methadone maintenance performed significantly better on measures of retention, opioid use, and opioid craving than either the low-dose methadone or the buprenorphine group at both 26-week and 52-week time points. The authors evaluated the relationship of methadone dose to retention in treatment and to urine tests for morphine and cocaine in a cohort of 610 opioid users"

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a low-technology environment of care and a nurse case management case delivery system (special care unit, SCU) with the traditional high-technology environment (ICU) and primary nursing care delivery system on the patient outcomes of length of stay, mortality, readmission, complications, satisfaction, and cost. A sample of 220 chronically critically ill patients were randomly assigned to either the SCU (n = 145) or the ICU (n = 75). Few significant differences were found between the two groups in length of stay, mortality, or complications. However, the findings showed significant cost savings in the SCU group in the charges accrued during the study period and in the charges and costs to produce a survivor. The average total cost of delivering care was $5,000 less per patient in the SCU than in the traditional ICU. In addition, the cost to produce a survivor was $19,000 less in the SCU. Results from this 4-year clinical trial demonstrate that nurse case managers in a SCU setting can produce patient outcomes equal to or better than those in the traditional ICU care environment for long-term"

A total of 57 patients were randomized to the thrombolytic therapy group, and 57 patients were randomized to the operative therapy group. Thrombolytic therapy resulted in dissolution of the occluding thrombus in 40 (70%) patients. Although the cumulative limb salvage rate was similar in the two treatment groups (82% at 12 months), the cumulative survival rate was significantly improved in patients randomized to the thrombolysis group (84% vs 58% at 12 months, p = 0.01). The benefits of thrombolysis were achieved without significant differences in the duration of hospitalization (median 11 days) and with only modest increases in hospital cost in the thrombolytic treatment arm (median $15,672 vs $12,253, p = 0.02). Intraarterial thrombolytic therapy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications and a corresponding increase in patient survival rates.

Thirteen patients with moderately severe myasthenia gravis participated in a double-blind study using either 100 mg of prednisone or an equivalen numbder of placebo tablets on alternate days. At the end of 6 months the code was broken. Seven patients were on placebo and three of these had improved to such a degree that steroid therapy was not indicated. Four of these patients ultimately were started on prednisone and improved. Of the six patients on prednisone, three showed no improvement and three were improved. At the end of 2 years, the seven patients still taking prednisone were on maintenance dosage of this drug. Three of this group had experienced relapses when the dosage was cut to 15 to 25 mg on alternate days, and they again improved when the prednisone dosage was increased. No statistical evaluation is possible because of the small number of patients. It can be stated that seven patients improved with steroid therapy. Conversely, not all patients treated with alternate-day prednisone improved. Finally, any evaluation of treatment of myasthenia gravis must take into consideration the potential for spontaneous improvement, as demonstrated by three of the patients treated with placebo."

This study examines the effect of an interactive, school-based, self-esteem education program on the body image and eating attitudes and behaviors of young male and female adolescents following the program and after 12 months. All 470 eligible students (63% female) aged 11-14 years volunteered to participate. The intervention group students participated in the program, whereas the control group students received their scheduled personal development and health class. The program significantly improved the body satisfaction of the intervention students and significantly changed aspects of their self-esteem; social acceptance, physical appearance, and athletic ability became less important for the intervention students and more important for control students. Female intervention students rated their physical appearance as perceived by others significantly higher than control students and allowed their body weight to increase appropriately by preventing the age increase in weight-losing behaviors of the control students. One year after the intervention, body image and attitude changes were still present. These findings also held for the 116 students (63% females) with low self-esteem and higher anxiety, who were considered at risk for the development of eating disorders.

126,CD002911,"Results for the 12-week program indicate that after the second week of treatment, the contiguous and delayed models of alarm produced comparable reductions in weekly wetting frequency that were significantly better than no treatment at all. Results indicated a significantly higher rate of apparatus malfunction for the delayed model of alarm. It is proposed that the contiguous alarm is the treatment of choice at the present time because of its significantly lower rate of malfunction.. The results indicated a significantly more effective outcome for the conditioning approach. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment measures of adjustment provided insufficient evidence to support the hypotheses that either change in the frequency of nighttime wetting or the method of treatment received would influence the subject's level of emotional and behavioral adjustment. The enuresis tolerance scale was found to be a highly significant predictor of early termination from conditioning treatment.. A comparison of two approaches to the treatment of nocturnal enuresis and the prediction of effectiveness using pre-treatment variables. This study compared the effectiveness of the enuresis alarm alone with a brief version of Dry Bed Training in treating 74 enuretic children. Both procedures were equally effective, and in the total sample a better response to treatment was predicted by the child's report of being teased by siblings. Maternal anger was associated with a greater"

The objective was to investigate whether acupuncture could be a reasonable option for augmentation in labor after spontaneous rupture of membranes at term and to look for possible effects on the progress of labor. In a randomized controlled trial 100 healthy parturients, with spontaneous rupture of membranes at term, were assigned to receive either acupuncture or no acupuncture. The main response variables were the duration of active labor, the amount of oxytocin given, and number of inductions. Duration of labor was significantly reduced (mean difference 1.7 h, p=0.03) and there was significant reduction in the need for oxytocin infusion to augment labor in the study group compared to the control group (odds ratio 2.0, p=0.018). We also discovered that the participants in the acupuncture group who needed labor induction had a significantly shorter duration of active phase than the ones induced in the control group (mean difference 3.6 h, p=0.002). Acupuncture may be a good alternative or complement to pharmacological methods in the effort to facilitate birth and provide normal delivery for women with prelabor rupture of membranes.."

Asthma patients pose special problems as far as the medical supervision, danger of symptoms and the course of the disease are concerned. Some 90 asthma patients were registered for the treatment in the Heidelberg Medical Clinic. 31 patients who were interested in taking part were randomized into 3 groups: two treatment group consisted of the exchange of information, discussion sessions on the illness as well as 'autogenic training' or 'functional relaxation'. The third group was the control group. Before and after treatment the patients were submitted to a thorough examination both of lungs and other internal organs as well as from the psychodiagnostical point of view. The average age of the patients was 43.5 years and the average duration of illness 16.8 years. Nevertheless, the treatment group's sympathomimetics use was significantly reduced by 1 year of treatment (p less than 0.05); the use of steroids decreased as well. These results support the conclusion that psychosomatic group therapy can make an important contribution to the treatment of asthma patients. Body therapy practised in 'autogenic training' and 'functional relaxation' seems to be another important healing factor for the treatment"

Troleandomycin (TAO), a macrolide antibiotic, was studied as an alternative treatment in 18 children with severe, steroid-requiring asthma. In this investigation three treatment arms were used in randomized, double-blind, parallel fashion: combination TAO and methylprednisolone (MPn), combination TAO and prednisone, and MPn alone. All groups tolerated a considerable reduction in glucocorticoid dose over the 12 weeks of the study: 80% +/- 6% for TAO-MPn, 55% +/- 8% for TAO-prednisone, and 44% +/- 14% for MPn alone. These reductions are all statistically significant (p < 0.05) within groups, and the differences between groups were statistically significant between the TAO-MPn and MPn alone groups. Low-dose TAO combined with MPn has a significant effect on methylprednisolone clearance in children, an effect equivalent to that reported with higher dose TAO (1000 mg/d) therapy. In addition, this preliminary study suggests that TAO may decrease bronchial hyper"

Fifty boys presenting for day case circumcision were allocated randomly to receive either caudal analgesia or dorsal nerve block (DNB) to provide postoperative pain relief. Analgesia was assessed by a single, unbiased observer utilising a three-point scale. Subsequently, parents completed a simple questionnaire. There was no difference between the groups in time to first requirement for analgesia or number of doses of paracetamol given in the first 24 h. Almost half the boys in the caudal group had motor weakness, and there was a significant increase in time to first micturition in that group. There was no difference between the groups in PONV, eating, sleeping or behavioural disturbance. Caudal anaesthesia with bupivacaine/ketamine does not confer any advantage over a dorsal nerve block with the doses used in this study. Because of the higher incidence of side-effects and technique failure in the caudal group, dorsal nerve block is perhaps the preferred technique.."

A controlled study concerning the surgical use of a fibrin glue was conducted in 50 patients undergoing partial pulmonary excision. In 25 of these patients, chosen at random, hemostasis and aerostasis of the fissural, and/or intersegmentary dissection planes were achieved by electrocoagulation, in the other 25 by the application of fibrin glue. The statistical study did not show any significant difference between the two groups in terms of the surgical indication, the type of excision and the associated surgical procedures (pleurectomy and parietectomy). No significant statistical difference was observed concerning the quality of aerostasis, the post-operative drainage, the persistance of residual collection or faulty reexpansion after removal of the latter, and the necessity for repeated drainage. The same applied to the length of post-operative hospital stay. This study seems to demonstrate that the surgical application of fibrin glue on the fissural and/or intersegmentary dissection planes is feasible but, as compared to electrocoagulation, does not significantly improve the quality of the surgical results for partial pulmonary excision; however"

Dutch South East Cooperative Urological Group. Prophylactic intravesical treatment with chemotherapeutic agents or one of the different strains of the immunomodulator bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) reduces tumor recurrence and may prevent progression after transurethral resection (TUR) of superficial bladder cancer. Clinical and pathological prognostic factors are used to categorize different groups at risk for disease recurrence and progression. Solitary low-grade (G1, 2A), low-stage (pTa) tumors have less than a 5% risk of progression, while pT1 G3 tumors with concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS) have a considerably higher risk of progression and metastases. The Dutch Cooperative Trial evaluated mitomycin versus BCG-Tice versus BCG-RIVM in 469 patients with pTA/pT1 carcinoma and CIS"

The collaborative intervention was compared to an individual intervention where the person with dementia received the same training but without the participating caregiver and to a control group of couples receiving no training. The results showed that following collaborative intervention recall performance in two collaborative tasks became more equally shared between the spouses, reflected in a decrease in recall for the caregiver and in an increase in recall for the spouse with dementia between pre- and post-test; whereas for the other two groups the caregivers dominated collaborative recall both at pre- and post-test. The results also showed that the persons with dementia in the collaborative group improved their individually assessed episodic memory performance as compared to the persons with dementia in the other two groups.

We analyzed the data for the total randomized population and for the 358 patients in whom the initial protocol specifications were met (the valid study group). No other pairwise comparisons demonstrated differences significant at the 0.05 level. However, the combination of BCNU plus high-dose methylprednisolone tended to be less effective than BCNU alone in patients with poor prognosis. This study indicates that BCNU and procarbazine are moderately useful agents in conjunction with radiotherapy for patients with malignant glioma. In addition, future protocols may allow use of corticosteroids in conventional dosages for treating cerebral edema and controlling symptoms; conclusions based on survival as the endpoint are unlikely to be affected by administering steroids at somewhat greater than the usual dose.

The results of this pilot study suggest that treatment of vasodepressor CSS with midodrine significantly reduced the rate of symptom reporting and attenuated SBP decreases after CSM but increased mean 24-hour ambulatory BP. One patient had to discontinue taking midodrine due to severe side effects and another six patients experienced minor side effects that did not require drug discontinuation. Midodrine appeared to provide a significant benefit in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. To prevent recurrence of symptoms, dose adjustments were required in about one third of patients.."

In an uncontrolled study, 80 percent of 32 patients with active ulcerative colitis refractory to corticosteroid therapy had a response to cyclosporine therapy. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in which cyclosporine (4 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 20 patients with severe ulcerative colitis whose condition had not improved after at least 7 days of intravenous corticosteroid therapy. A response to therapy was defined as an improvement in a numerical symptom score (0 indicated no symptoms, and 21 severe symptoms) leading to discharge from the hospital and treatment with oral medications. Failure to respond to therapy resulted in colectomy, but some patients in the placebo group who had no response and no urgent need for surgery were subsequently treated with cyclosporine.

The primary efficacy measure was the distribution of outcomes at 3 months after stroke using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) based on an ordinal regression model of outcomes, adjusting for baseline severity of stroke, age, and interval from stroke. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 5 days was diagnosed in 7 of 195 (3.6%) patients treated with abciximab and 2 of 199 (1%) patients given placebo (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P=0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0"

The authors compared the efficacy and safety of three atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone) with one another and with haloperidol in the treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In a double-blind trial, 157 inpatients with a history of suboptimal treatment response were randomly assigned to treatment with clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol for 14 weeks (an 8-week escalation and fixed-dose period followed by a 6-week variable-dose period). Clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine (but not haloperidol) resulted in statistically significant improvements in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Improvements seen in total and negative symptom scores with clozapine and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol. The overall pattern of results suggests that clozapine and olanzapine have similar general antipsychotic"

Results of a double-blind study]. after treatment were: subjective response; claudication and maximum walking distances; ankle systolic indices; maximum blood flow in the lower limb by gravimetric plethysmography; plasma fibrinogen; erythrocyte deformability and whole blood viscosity. There was a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in mean erythrocyte deformability in the oxpentifylline group but not in the placebo group; this apparent difference between the groups, however, was not significant. The placebo group showed a significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in claudication distance and mean plasma fibrinogen concentration, but no such improvements were observed in the oxpentifylline group. There were no significant differences in either of the two groups with regard to the subjective response, ankle systolic indices, maximum limb blood flow or whole blood viscosity. It is concluded that oxpentifylline, when taken in oral form at the dose used in this study, increased erythrocyte deformability without conferring any clinical or haemorrheological benefit to patients with intermittent"

In this study, the subjects were selected by the emergency unit psychiatrist from patients who were admitted to the emergency unit with pseudoseizure.The diagnoses was based on DSM-IV criteria. Paradoxical intention was applied to half of the 30 patients with conversion disorders; the other half were treated with diazepam in order to examine the efficiency of the paradoxical intention versus diazepam. In both groups the differences of the anxiety scores at the beginning of the study were found to be insignificant (z=1.08, p=0.28). Of the 15 patients who completed paradoxical intention treatment, 14 (93.3%) responded favorably to paradoxical intention. On the other hand of 15 patients who completed diazepam therapy, 9 (60%) responded well to therapy and 6 patients carried on their conversion symptoms at the end of 6 weeks.

This article reports preliminary results of studies concerning the relative effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation, general conditioning exercises, and vestibular suppressant medication on dizziness and imbalance in patients with chronic vestibular symptoms of at least 6 months duration. Patients with positional and/or movement-related dizziness and abnormal posturography were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups. Preliminary results suggest that although all three treatment approaches reduce dizziness, only vestibular rehabilitation also improves balance. This study takes the first step toward determining the efficacy of a specific exercise approach for reducing dizziness and imbalance in patients with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders. The results were compared in regard to the signs and symptoms observed in the three groups of patients at 15 days, one month and at three months of treatment. The SM was effective in 80% of the patients at 15 days of treatment versus 45% of those receiving only VRE. The third group of patients, receiving the combined treatment, demonstrated a cure in 100% of the cases when evaluated at three months while only 66% of the SM group were found to be asym"

The trial was designed to detect a 50% improvement in survival with 83% power. Nine complete (CRs) and 18 partial responses (PRs) were observed in the patients who received treatments that contained IFN compared with four CRs and 18 PRs in the patients who received treatments that did not contain IFN. Five CRs and 20 PRs occurred in patients treated with TMX compared with eight CRs and 16 PRs in those treated without TMX. Response differences were nonsignificant. The overall median TTF was 2.6 months, and the overall median survival was 8.9 months. There was no significant difference in TTF or survival among any of the different treatments. Poor performance status (PS), hepatic metastases, and weight loss were significant adverse prognostic factors. Twenty-three patients had a TTF greater than 20 months, and these durable responses were evenly distributed among the treatment arms.

Weekly reports of high-risk indicators designed to monitor the course of treatment were obtained from physically abused, school-aged children and their parents/guardians who were randomly assigned to Individual Child and Parent Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT) or Family Therapy (FT). Between 20% and 23% of the two informant's reports acknowledged high levels of physical discipline/force during the early and late phases of treatment, respectively, and an even higher percentage of cases reported heightened parental anger and family problems. Early treatment reports from both informants predicted late period reports, but only parent reports were related to validity measures. The overall levels of parental anger and physical discipline/force were lower in CBT than FT families, though each group showed a reduction on these items from the early to late treatment sessions.. The lack of demonstrated effect on children may reflect the need for a larger and more sustained treatment dose and/or the need to include parent-child interaction opportunities in the program. At the same time, while treatment gains were limited to the parent, the high treatment adherence rate (92% attended six or more of the eight program sessions) and low attrition rate (n=1) indicate"

The study was performed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of 10 days with doses of propranolol, 80 mg twice a day, pindolol, 5 mg twice a day, labetalol, 200 mg twice a day, and labetalol, 400 mg twice a day as active drug. Heart rate was lowest during propranolol dosing and blood pressure was lowest during labetalol dosing irrespective of the labetalol dose used. The degree of peripheral arterial disease modulated the effect of beta-blockade on limb circulation. In the less symptomatic limbs, reactive hyperemic flow was greater after pindolol than after the other drugs and did not differ from the level recorded after placebo. These differences were inconsistent and small in the more symptomatic limbs. Thus as the peripheral arterial disease became more severe and extensive, beta-blockade"

After weaknesses were identified in the hospital's system for reporting and evaluating medication errors, a multidisciplinary task force was formed to redesign the hospital's medication error-reporting system. Its guiding principles were as follows: anonymity and freedom from punitive action are essential for increasing the number of reports, rating medication errors facilitates identification of areas for system improvement, potential errors provide valuable insight into the system's vulnerabilities, and timely review of reports enables rapid systematic correction. To support the intended nonpunitive culture, the term medication-use variance was used in lieu of medication error for any unplanned event that deviates from the intended course of prescribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring medications. The most difficult decision for the task force was deciding whether the process should be anonymous. After getting the support of the medical-legal counsel and the quality improvement department for an anonymous reporting process, the task force agreed to test it in the department of pharmacy and in three patient units in September 1998.

There was a single case of shoulder impingement in the DCP group and six in the IMN group. Of these six, five occurred after antegrade insertion of an IMN. In the DCP group three patients developed complications, compared with 13 in the IMN group. We had to perform secondary surgery on seven patients in the IMN group, but on only one in the DCP group (p = 0.016). Our findings suggest that open reduction and internal fixation with a DCP remains the best treatment"

To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with interferon, we studied 42 patients with chronic hepatitis D who were randomly assigned to receive either 9 million or 3 million units of recombinant interferon alfa-2a (three times a week for 48 weeks) or no treatment. By the end of the treatment period, serum alanine aminotransferase values had become normal in 10 of 14 patients receiving 9 million units (71 percent), as compared with 4 of 14 treated with 3 million units (29 percent, P = 0.029) and 1 of 13 untreated controls (8 percent, P = 0.001). Seven patients treated with the higher dose of interferon (50 percent) had a complete response (normal levels of alanine aminotransferase and no detectable serum hepatitis delta virus [HDV] RNA), as compared with three of those who received the lower dose (21 percent, P = 0.118), and none of the controls (P = 0.004).

CCr (verified with simultaneous inulin clearances x 12, r = 0.93, P < 0.001) increased significantly by eight hours of ANP treatment to 17.1 +/- 3.2 ml/min and by 24 hours after discontinuing ANP to 21.0 +/- 4.4 ml/min (both P < 0.05). There was no corresponding increase in CCr in Group II. Dialysis was required in 23% of Group I and in 52% of Group II patients (different at P < 0.05). Mortality rates of 17% for Group I and 35% for Group II were not significantly different (P = 0.11). It is concluded that parenteral ANP increases CCr and reduces need for dialysis in patients with established intrinsic ARF.

Evidence suggests that synthetic surfactants consisting solely of phospholipids can be improved through the addition of peptides, such as sinapultide, that mimic the action of human surfactant protein-B (SP-B). A synthetic surfactant containing a mimic of SP-B may also reduce the potential risks associated with the use of animal-derived products. Therefore, we compared lucinactant (Surfaxin; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with porcine-derived, poractant alfa (Curosurf; Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) in a trial to test for noninferiority. A total of 252 infants born between 24 and 28 weeks of completed gestation, with birth weights between 600 and 1250 g, were assigned randomly in a multicenter, multinational, noninferiority, randomized, controlled study to receive either lucinactant (n = 124) or poractant alfa (n = 128) within 30 minutes of"

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the alpha4 integrin-specific humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab in 248 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: two infusions of placebo; one infusion of 3 mg of natalizumab per kilogram of body weight, followed by placebo; two infusions of 3 mg of natalizumab per kilogram; or two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram. Outcomes included changes in scores for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (higher scores indicate more severe disease), the health-related quality of life, and C-reactive protein levels. The group given two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram did not have a significantly higher rate of clinical remission (defined by a score of less than 150 on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index) than the placebo group at week 6 (the prospectively"

The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) measured over 12 h after 12 wk of treatment. Patients were stratified on the basis of bronchodilator response to albuterol (> 12% and > 200-ml improvement) and were randomized within each stratum. Salmeterol provided similar maximal bronchodilatation to ipratropium but had a longer duration of action and a more constant bronchodilatory effect with no evidence of bronchodilator tolerance. Analyses of time to first COPD exacerbation revealed salmeterol to be superior to placebo and ipratropium (p < 0.05). These collective data support the use of salmeterol as first-line bronchodilator therapy for the long-term treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with"

The aim of this study was to test low-fat nutritional solutions, with or without fish oil, on protein metabolism, morbidity, and length of care in severely burned adults. In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 43 patients were assigned to one of the following groups: control (35% fat), low-fat solution (ie, 15% of total calories as fat), low-fat with fish oil, given for 30 days. Corticosteroid-binding globulin and total and free serum cortisol were measured every 3 days. Compared with controls, patients on low-fat support had fewer cases of pneumonia: 3/24 vs 7/13 (p =.02), better respiratory and nutrition status, and shorter time to healing: 1.2 vs 1.8 days/% burned area (p = 0.01).

Among the obese participants, change in glucose was marginally greater with the higher dose pill (p=.06); otherwise, changes between the body mass index groups were not modified by pill dose. The most dramatic and probably most clinically important changes were an increase in triglycerides and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol. The present data indicate that in contrast to OC use, vaginal contraception with the ring does not deteriorate SI. The vaginal ring may represent an appropriate choice for long-term contraception in women at risk for developing diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. The lipoprotein, SHBG, and protein S and factor V differences are likely due to the lesser androgenicity of DSG allowing for a greater expression of the dose of estrogen. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups, and none were serious. Most mean changes from baseline laboratory values were comparable between groups, although the mean increase in cholesterol concentration was statistically significantly lower in the levonorgestrel with ethinyl estradiol group. Changes in triglyceride and glucose concentrations were not statistically significantly different between groups. Levonorgestrel"

There was a 2-fold decline in the rate of fatal injury after revision of the standard, which substantially exceeded the decline in other causes of fatal injury in the construction industry during the same period. The decline was somewhat greater in large business firms but was evident in construction firms of all size classes. The fatality rate from trench cave-in in union construction workers was approximately half that of nonunion workers, but we were unable to determine whether this was best explained by union status, employment of union workers at larger construction firms, or both..

Parental presence during induction of anesthesia enhanced the effect of oral midazolam on emergence behavior of children undergoing general anesthesia. children who received midazolam were significantly less anxious during the induction of anesthesia than children in the music therapy and control groups (P = 0.015 and P = 0.005, respectively). We found no difference in anxiety during the induction of anesthesia between children in the music therapy group and children in the control group. An analysis controlling for therapist revealed a significant therapist effect; i.e., children treated by one of the therapists were significantly less anxious than children in the other therapist group and the control group on separation to the operating room (OR) (P < 0.05) and on entrance to the OR (P < 0.05), but not on the introduction of the anesthesia mask (P = not significant).

To design a treatment manual and adherence measure for attachment-based family therapy (ABFT) for adolescent depression and to collect pilot data on the treatment's efficacy. Over a period of 2 years, 32 adolescents meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of ABFT or a 6-week, minimal-contact, waitlist control group. The sample was 78% female and 69% African American; 69% were from low-income, inner-city communities. At post-treatment, 81% of the patients treated with ABFT no longer met criteria for MDD, in contrast with 47% of patients in the waitlist group. Mixed factorial analyses of variance revealed that, compared with the waitlist group, patients treated with ABFT showed a significantly greater reduction in both depressive and anxiety symptoms and family conflict. Of the 15 treated cases assessed at the follow-up, 13 patients (87%) continued to not meet criteria for MDD 6 months after treatment ended.

Extensive neurotologic examination confirmed the diagnosis. Patients were followed up prospectively for 1 month. Of the 10 patients receiving methylprednisolone, 9 had a marked reduction of vertiginous symptoms and 1 switched to the placebo medication. Of the 10 patients receiving placebo, 3 had relief of vertiginous symptoms, while the 7 with persistent symptoms switched to methylprednisolone and had subsequent effective reduction of vertigo within 24 hours. The electronystagmogram returned to normal within 1 month in all 16 patients taking methylprednisolone, but remained abnormal in 2 of the 4 patients treated with placebo. One patient receiving methylprednisolone had a relapse of symptoms when the dosage was tapered, but symptoms again remitted when the dosage was increased to 32 mg/d. From this double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we conclude that methylprednisolone is much more effective than placebo in reducing vertiginous symptoms in patients with acute vest"
439,CD008643,"To define the usefulness of the lumbar spine x-ray series in the emergency department and to generate clinical criteria for optimizing its application, we retrospectively studied 552 consecutive emergency department patients for whom lumbar spine x-rays were ordered. Patients' histories and physical examination findings were correlated with four groups of radiological findings: (1) radiologically normal, (2) incidental findings unrelated to patients' complaints, (3) diagnostic films compatible with symptoms, and (4) radiological findings of questionable clinical significance. The prevalence of reported lumbar spine degeneration increased with age to 71% in patients aged 65-74 years. The overall prevalence of fracture, possible infection, possible tumour was low in our study population: 4, 0.8 and 0.7%, respectively. Fracture and possible infection showed no association with age. Possible tumour was only reported in patients older than 55 years of age. Although the prevalence of degenerative changes was high in older patients, the therapeutic consequences of diagnosing this abnormality are minor..

Recent retrospective trials stated that a benefit of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer may be limited to patients in whom a complete cytoreduction (R0) could be achieved. Most of them pointed out there was no difference in survival between residual disease of 0.1-1 cm (R1) and >1 cm (R2). The median survival of the entire cohort was 31.7 months, with an estimated 5-year survival of 31.1%. The median survival and estimated 5-year survival for patients with R1 were 31.1 months and 23.9%, and there were significant differences in survival when compared to 15.6 months and 6.4% in R2 (chi(2) = 7.45, P = 0.006), 63.2 months (mean survival) and 54.4% in complete cytoreduction (chi(2) = 8.93, P = 0.0028).

However, the frequency of systemic reactions to subsequent stings in unimmunized adults with previous reactions is approximately 60 percent. To determine which factors, in addition to a history of reaction and evidence of venom-specific IgE antibody, predispose patients to future insect-sting reactions, we studied a venom-sensitive group of children who were deemed to be at relatively low risk for severe reactions; 28 percent of them received venom therapy. We studied 242 children, 2 through 16 years of age, each of whom had had a systemic allergic reaction, affecting only the skin, to an insect sting. Each child had a positive skin-test reaction to one or more of five hymenopteran venoms. Sixty-eight children received immunotherapy with insect venom and 174 did not; about half were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and the rest were assigned on the basis of the patient's (or the parents') choice The results of accidental stings during four years of observation were evaluated.
