CD000024,"DVT appears to be effective in preventing pulmonary embolism and in reducing the risk of death from ischemic stroke. However, there was only a small number of patients studied and the results of the trials were not always significant. Consequently these data should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence becomes available."
CD000074,"Doxapram appears to be beneficial for the infants with apnea. However, the data on the use of doxapram in this manner are limited due to the small number of infants included in the trials and the heterogeneity of the assessment. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of doxapram treatment compared to other treatments and the duration of response."
CD000116,"There is evidence from one trial that ST waveform analysis reduces the frequency of interventions in labour, and may have benefits on the length of gestation and the length of NICU stay. There is no evidence that ST waveform analysis reduces the frequency of interventions in labour, and may have benefits on the length of NICU stay and the length of NICU stay."
CD000123,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about cholesterollowering drug effects were not changed. Given availability of more effective treatments including statins and parenteral gold, cholesterol-lowering drug effects are likely to be beneficial."
CD000143,"CPAP is effective in reducing frequency of reintubation and in decreasing the risk of acute and chronic respiratory distress. However, there was no significant reduction in the frequency of reintubation and in the frequency of reintubation, which may explain why there is limited evidence for a benefit in early extubation. There is no apparent benefit in frequency of reintubation and in the number of reintubation patients"
CD000146,"The benefits of nicotine patches for people with smoking cessation are firmly established. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of nicotine patches, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD000168,There is no evidence to suggest that skin traction reduces pain in patients with displaced fractures. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD000220,"We found a small benefit from the use of metronidazole for women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis while increasing the risk for death. However, most of the women were in groups were notigible for further treatment. The results suggest that metronidazole should be offered to women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis while increasing the risk for death."
CD000238,"There is no evidence to suggest that supplemental oxygen, when used in the treatment of COPD, has an effect on mortality or length of hospitalisation. The findings do not apply to the use of domiciliary air, which is routinely used in the treatment of COPD."
CD000246,Antibiotic therapy should be offered to women with preterm labour who are wishing to preserve their fertility.
CD000254,"Zinc, vitamin D and antioxidants appear to have some small effects on visual acuity in people with age-related macular degeneration.

CD000305,"Hydrocortisone appears to be beneficial for the prevention of deep venous thromboembolic events. However, there was little evidence from the trials on the period after surgery and in the following days. There was a 10% and 42% reduction for participants in the control group and entacapone groups, respectively, although these results were not statistically significant. The entacapone groups were more likely to experience bleeding after surgery. In the patients with prior thromboembolic events where"
CD000345,Hydrocorticosteroids have some theoretical advantages over oral non-opioid drugs but should currently be restricted to individual patients. Long-term data are needed on the effectiveness of corticosteroids in treating chronic hepatitis B.
CD000369,"Hydrocortisone may be as effective as interferon when used as a primary treatment for acute hepatitis C. However, the long-term safety data on the use of hydrocortisone in this manner is unknown. Steroids are effective in treating acute hepatitis C without an increase in the risk of chronic hepatitis C. However, long-term safety or benefit data is lacking. Steroids are effective in treating acute hepatitis C without an increase in the risk of chronic hepatitis C. However"
CD000405,"Vancomycin is effective in preventing necrotising enterocolitis from occurring in preterm infants. However, it is not effective in preventing necrotising enterocolitis from occurring in term neonates. This is based on a small number of randomised controlled trials."
CD000409,There is evidence that educational or quasi-educational interventions can lead to changes in the way primary care physicians prescribe antibiotics.

CD000460,"Oral aspirin challenge results in a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in bronchial symptoms in patients with chronic asthma. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct trials that would allow clinicians to observe and report on the effects of different aspirin challenge strategies on long-term pulmonary outcomes."
CD000479,"There is no evidence to suggest that varicocele treatment improves fertility in men undergoing varicocele treatment, or in women undergoing varicocele treatment,. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."

The administration of buffered non-buffered fluid to adult patients in resuscitation is equally safe and effective as the administration of buffered non-buffered fluid to adult patients in resuscitation
CD000934,There is no evidence to suggest that the frequency of prenatal visits decreases in the event of a high-risk pregnancy or neonatal care event. There is a risk of syphilis among women in the new model (1.69% vs 1.38%; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.99) but no significant effect on other outcomes. Women in the new model were more satisfied and willing to continue with pregnancy but dissatisfied and unable to continue. The women in the new model were more
CD000948,We found no clear evidence to support or refute the use of OT or NT for ventilatory assistance in preterm infants.
CD000972,"There is no evidence to suggest that the use of high-dose dexamethasone for treating cerebral malaria is effective. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of the use of high-dose dexamethasone for treating cerebral malaria."
CD000978,"There is increasing evidence that psychostimulant trials provide evidence for reducing mucositis rates and in doing so, reduce the risk of 5-FU-induced stomatitis. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of psychostimulant to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased adverse outcomes. These drugs can no longer be recommended in the treatment of mucositis."
CD000980,"Vitamin C has a clinical benefit in the treatment of common cold. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin C in the treatment of common cold. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."

CD001005,"The use of educational programs for patients with asthma is not new, and there is evidence that the programs increase patient satisfaction, reduce hospital admissions and improve clinical outcomes. However, there was little evidence from the studies on the period after education had finished and no information about the long-term effects of the program was given. The few studies that did produce data were of high methodological quality and were not used to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the program. The low quality and small sample size of the studies made it difficult to arrive at conclusions about the effectiveness of the program."
CD001018,H2RA appears to have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on women with premenopausal symptoms. The beneficial effects of H2RA on women with premenopausal symptoms are not clear.
CD001024,"Treatment of HCC with estrogen-receptor blockers is not effective in prolonging life in patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Patients with whiplash injury treated within eight hours of injury are more likely to report pain,"
CD001055,"The interventions included in this review provide evidence that, in most cases, a psychologist or other professional advisor provides the information, support and guidance needed to help women quit smoking during pregnancy. This information can be used to support or modify smoking cessation policies."
CD001059,"Calcium supplementation reduces the risk of preeclampsia and preterm labour in women with hypertension. This results from a meta-analysis of 9 randomised controlled trials, including a crossover between groups. No significant differences were found in calcium intake or use from the two groups.

CD001066,There is no evidence to suggest a difference in symptom relief for the use of lymphatic technique reflexology or relaxing reflexology in the treatment of post-term labour pain in women with preterm labour. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001069,"The previous version of this review showed that oral pain medication reduced pain during heel prick procedures and in certain circumstances appeared to be an effective analgesic in the absence of pharmacological evidence. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of infants, oral pain medication is more effective than non-psychological drugs in reducing pain. In addition to basing conclusions on randomized controlled trials, the review provides evidence that in a similar population of infants, oral pain medication"

Given the poor quality of the trials, it is difficult to assess the value of Aduvant for patients with uter"
CD001431,"The use of decision making tools to inform patients about their choices regarding prostate cancer screening and local treatment is growing. While the effectiveness of these decision making tools is unclear, it seems to be beneficial to inform patients about the available evidence. In addition to providing information about screening, decision making should also include consideration of patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life measures, and patient-centric caregiving practices. Consensus regarding the effectiveness of decision making tools for informing patients about their prostate cancer screening and local treatment is important."
