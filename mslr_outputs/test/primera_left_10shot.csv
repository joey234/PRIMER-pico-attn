462,CD009593,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two methods for the detection of tuberculosis and its drug resistance. The results suggest that the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is effective in detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in respiratory and extra-pulmonary samples. It is more effective than other nucleic acid amplification methods in detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in these settings but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain people tend to prefer automated tests to mycobacterial culture. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of reachingTB. Short-term data indicate that the Xpert MTB
463,CD009755,We found no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of preterm birth or small- for-gestational-age birth. There was a small reduction in the risk of fetal death and small- for-gestational-age birth from the small numbers of studies to date.

468,CD010610,"We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in migraine frequency was achieved with the use of exercise compared to no intervention or placebo. The results suggest that topiramate may be effective in preventing migraine when used in conjunction with other anticonvulsants such as propranolol. However, this could be because the two trials were separated into two separate trials. The two trials were greatly underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between them. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing entacapone with active comparators. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to compare the effect of topir"
