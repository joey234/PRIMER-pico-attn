However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
1,CD000074,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in certain infants, theophylline may be associated with a short-term response to placebo, and in other infants, theophylline may be associated with a longer-term response. However, the evidence produced by these studies is not adequate to recommend the use of theophylline for the treatment of apnea of prematurity."
2,CD000116,"There is evidence from one trial that intrapartum fetal monitoring with ST analysis reduces the risk of metabolic acidosis and the need for operative intervention in women with high-risk labours. There is no evidence that the use of ST analysis alone reduces the incidence of neonatal acidemia or metabolic acidosis, and there is no evidence that the use of any intervention is associated with an improvement in perinatal outcome."
3,CD000123,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about the effectiveness of probucol did not change. Given availability of more effective treatments including cholesterol lowering drugs and dietary supplements, policosanol does not have a significant place in therapy based on available evidence."
4,CD000143,"Use of N-CPAP for a short period (24 hr) following extubation is associated with a lower failure rate than use of headbox oxygen or nasal CPAP. However, there is no evidence of effect of N-CPAP on total number of days of ventilation (as assessed by the roentgenographic scores) and there is no evidence of a difference in the rate of failure of respiratory distress. There is no apparent benefit of N-CPAP on total number of days of ventilation (as assessed by the roentgenographic scores) and there is no evidence of a difference in the rate of failure of respiratory"
5,CD000146,There is increasing evidence that different nicotine replacement therapies are effective for differentiating between them and for different outcomes. This is based on randomized controlled trials of different types of nicotine replacement therapy. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies the effectiveness of different nicotine replacement therapies.
6,CD000168,"Preoperative skin traction may offer a small pain relief in patients with proximal femoral fractures when used in a safe and effective manner. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this treatment in the situation described. In addition, most of the patients found the application of skin traction to be painful. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be conducted in settings where several individuals are involved."
7,CD000220,"There is evidence from one trial that treatment of asymptomatic trichomoniasis in pregnant women reduces the risk of preterm delivery. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the continued use of metronidazole as a treatment for trichomoniasis in pregnant women."
8,CD000238,"There is limited evidence to suggest that supplemental oxygen increases exercise performance in patients with severe COPD. However, there is no evidence that the small improvements in exercise performance are attributable to the use of oxygen. Further studies are needed to determine if the small improvements in exercise performance seen in this review are attributable to the use of oxygen or not."
9,CD000246,No evidence is available using antibiotics for preterm labour with intact membranes.
10,CD000254,"There is no high quality evidence that zinc-monocysteine supplementation, when used alone, is associated with an improvement in the rate of visual impairment in people with age-related macular degeneration. There is limited evidence that the high concentration of carotenoids in the macula, plus evidence linking oxidative stress to age-related macular degeneration, have a positive effect on the rate of visual impairment. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration of zinc-monocysteine, and to examine the robustness of the effects of zinc-monocysteine on visual function."
11,CD000255,"Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is uncommon. In comparison to other carotid injuries, it is not associated with high mortality. However, it may be associated with a number of adverse outcomes, such as cerebral ischaemia or cranial nerve dysfunction.perceived benefit of anticoagulation in patients with CVD is limited due to the high mortality."
12,CD000259,"The use of feedback to improve the quality of primary healthcare is growing. There is increasing evidence that it is effective in reducing the use of antibiotics, improving the quality of primary healthcare overall and in improving the quality of healthcare in different settings. There is still a requirement for a large scale randomized controlled trial of high methodological quality."
13,CD000297,"Cyclosporine may have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with Crohn's disease. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment is not clear. In addition to corticosteroids, cyclosporine may be considered for treatment of active Crohn's disease. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment is not clear."
14,CD000305,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about the effectiveness of prophylaxis in preventing post-operative venous thromboembolic events were not changed. Given availability of more effective treatments including non-opioid drugs and non-opioid drugs, prophylaxis should be offered to those undergoing surgery for hip fracture."
15,CD000345,"There is no evidence of effect of interferon alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In patients with chronic HBB infection, interferon alone tends to result in a smaller mean reduction in transaminase activity than corticosteroid treatment. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of interferon alone in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In patients with chronic HBB infection, interferon tends to result in a smaller mean reduction in transaminase activity than corticosteroid treatment. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of interferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B."
16,CD000369,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of interferon-alpha in reducing the risk of chronic hepatitis C infection. In patients with acute post-transfusion hepatitis C, interferon may reduce the risk of serious adverse events such as aminotransferase flare-ups. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of interferon-alpha reduces the risk of acute hepatitis C becoming chronic."
17,CD000405,There is evidence from one trial that oral vancomycin prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis. This results from a small study and is not evidence from a large scale trial. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of oral vancomycin in the prophylaxis of NEC.
18,CD000409,The provision of nutritional support for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) varies widely both within and between institutions. We tested the hypothesis that evidence-based algorithms would be effective in reducing the use of these drugs. We also found evidence that interventions designed to make practice more evidence-based were effective.
19,CD000432,"Caffeine appears to have a small clinically important reduction in the risk of hypoxaemia in preterm infants. However, most of the trials were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes. Further trials are needed to confirm the preliminary results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of caffeine."
20,CD000436,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of dietary salt in the treatment of asthma. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
21,CD000460,"There is no evidence to suggest that ASA/ tartrazine/benzoate oral challenge results in a significant improvement in clinical symptoms. There is a evidence-based basis for the use of ASA/ tartrazine/benzoate in the management of asthma. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of ASA/ tartrazine/benzoate in the management of asthma."
22,CD000479," varicocele treatment is effective in terms of sperm concentration, motility and sperm motility in men with infertility. However, there is no evidence of effect on pregnancy. In the women of the study, there was a significant increase in the rate of pregnancy (13.5% in group I and 6.7% in group II) but no difference in the rate of pregnancy."
23,CD000483,There is no high quality evidence that prophylactic hyperdynamic postoperative fluid therapy reduces the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia or that it may increase the risk of preoperative vasospasm. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from prophylactic fluid therapy regarding mortality or morbidity in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
24,CD000491,"There is unclear evidence that amoxycillin is an effective single-dose treatment for bacteriuria in pregnancy. There is no evidence that the puerperium is more effective than amoxycillin, and there is no evidence that the two are superior. These results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. There is no evidence that the puerperium is more effective than amoxycillin, and there is no evidence that the two are superior."
25,CD000525,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the treatment of acute schizophrenia. There is limited evidence to support the use of haloperidol for the treatment of acute schizophrenia. There is limited evidence to support the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia.
26,CD000536,"Use of oral anticoagulation therapy for peripheral arterial bypass surgery is not effective, and causes significant complications. There is a risk of bleeding during and after surgery, and in patients with salvage surgery, there is a higher risk of major hemorrhagic events. 
Results from one trial suggest that heparin is an effective anticoagulation in the short term in patients with lower limb ischemia. However, there is no evidence of effect in the long term."
27,CD000567,"The benefits of intraoperative fluid administration and colloid osmotic pressure are clear in the treatment of patients with serious vascular surgery. However, the quality and quantity of the trials were insufficient to establish the safety or effectiveness of any specific interventions. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any adverse effects that might result from the use of intraoperative fluid."
28,CD000934,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from fewer antenatal visits in women at low risk of childbirth.
29,CD000948,"We found no clear evidence to support a difference in the effectiveness of oral versus nasal intubation for ventilatory assistance in neonates. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of both routes of intubation for short-term ventilatory assistance."
30,CD000972,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of dexamethasone for treating cerebral malaria. There is a high risk of serious adverse effects, particularly in long-term patients. Consequently, we recommend the use of a lower dose of dexamethasone and a placebo."
31,CD000978,"The benefits of topical G-CSF mouthwashes have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of topical G-CSF, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
32,CD000980, vitamin C may have some small benefits for people with respiratory infections. We recommend further well-designed trials on the subject.
33,CD000996,Inhaled corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial for patients with bronchiectasis. There is no evidence from the current trial data to support or refute the use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
34,CD001005,"The previous version of this review showed that education programs for people with asthma could reduce their use of hospital admissions and reduce their morbidity. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of patients, education does not increase the risk of death and may reduce asthma-related hospital admissions."
35,CD001018,"HRT may have some small benefits for women with cardiovascular risk factors. We recommend further well-designed trials on the effectiveness of post-menopausal hormone therapy be undertaken, that results should be reported according to socio-economic status, and that researchers gather robust data on both processes and carefully chosen outcomes."
36,CD001024,"Tamoxifen appears to be beneficial for patients with inoperable HCC. However, there is no evidence of effect in patients with terminal diseases and there is a risk of side effects. In patients with advanced HCC, tamoxifen appears to be beneficial for survival but there is no evidence of effect in QoL."
37,CD001036,"The quality of the cervical smears received is inadequate, due to the small number of endocervical cells found, and the small number of cells included in the smears. There is a evidence that the quality of CIN smears is improved when the endocervical cells are included."
38,CD001046,"There is evidence from one trial that methylprednisolone when administered within 8 hours of injury is effective in improving the recovery of motor function in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury. However, the results of the review did not allow conclusions about the effectiveness of methylprednisolone when administered in a more extended follow-up period. There is no definitive evidence from the second trial that methylprednisolone when administered within 8 hours of injury is effective."
39,CD001055,"The previous version of this review showed that smoking during pregnancy was effective in reducing the risk of miscarriage and in reducing the risk of preterm labour. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of women, smoking does not increase the risk of both of these outcomes."
40,CD001059,"Calcium supplementation is associated with a small reduction in the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. However, there is no evidence of a effect on the risk of preterm delivery or preclampsia. In addition, there is no evidence of a reduction in the risk of uterine smooth muscle contraction."
41,CD001062,"There is unclear evidence that abdominal decompression can be effective in preventing pre-eclampsia. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of abdominal decompression in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated focusing on administration."
42,CD001066,"We found a diversity of reflexology techniques, with different effects on symptom relief and legVolume changes in women with oedema. The most common effect on symptom relief was seen in the reflexology techniques that women had previously used, but there was no evidence for the other techniques."
43,CD001069,"There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with preterms, neonates, and older infants to significantly manage pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures."
44,CD001073,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of D-penicillamine in the prevention of ROP. When used in high quality clinical trials, D-penicillamine may have some benefit in preventing ROP. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of D-penicillamine in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated."
45,CD001112,"Caffeine, when used in high doses, appears to be an effective bronchodilator in people with asthma. However, the data on the effectiveness of caffeine in treating asthma is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information. Nevertheless, these data should make it difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of caffeine in treating asthma."
46,CD001162,"Sulpiride appears to be superior to perphenazine in treatment of acute schizophrenia. In the treatment of chronic schizophrenia, sulpiride appears to be superior to haloperidol. In the treatment of remitted schizophrenic outpatients, sulpiride appears to be superior to timiperone. In the treatment of chronic schizophrenia, sulpiride appears to be superior to haloperidol."
47,CD001168,"OLP is a chronic inflammatory disease that can be painful especially in the atrophic and erosive forms. Several therapies have been used with varying results, but most treatments are empirical and do not have adequate control groups or correct study designs. The aim of this review was to provide evidence that in the absence of a well-designed trial, topical corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of OLP."
48,CD001261,There is evidence that the locally produced Vi vaccine has a protective efficacy similar to the licensed Vi vaccine. There is no evidence that the exported Salmonella typhi Vi vaccine has a protective efficacy. There is evidence that the exported Salmonella typhi vaccine has a risk of side-effects.
49,CD001266,"The use of albuterol for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis is unclear. With little evidence of benefit from other bronchodilators, the decision to stop the use of albuterol for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis should be reconsidered."
50,CD001275,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of laser treatment for pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury. The use of laser for pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency of laser treatment and the duration of treatment.
51,CD001293,"The effectiveness of school-based prevention programs is increasing. There is increasing evidence that interventions are effective in reducing the use of tobacco and alcohol, and in preventing youth from becoming addicted to these products.
There is new safety data which indicates that interventions can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers."
52,CD001297,"Treatment with GnRH agonists can reduce the risk of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. However, there is no evidence that the effects of GnRH agonists on bone metabolism are associated with reduced efficacy. Conversely, treatment with GnRH agonists can increase the risk of endometriosis-associated uterine pain. However, there is no evidence that the effects of GnRH agonists on bone metabolism are associated with increased efficacy."
53,CD001331,"Corticotrophin treatment is an effective therapy for attacks of MS. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this treatment for people with chronic progressive disease. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
54,CD001332,"Tizanidine and baclofen are effective in reducing spasticity in patients with chronic sclerosis. The drugs have different side effects which suggest that each drug has a different set of side-effects. 
The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression."
55,CD001340,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ECMO for infants with respiratory failure in compared to CMT or other clinical trials. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in settings where CMT or other clinical trials are available.
56,CD001342,No evidence is available using anticoagulation drugs in patients with transient ischemic attacks or those with minor stroke of presumed arterial origin. The risk of major bleeding is increased with anticoagulation.
57,CD001351,The previous version of this review showed that acupuncture was effective for people with acute low back pain. This updated review provides evidence that it is effective for people with chronic low back pain.
58,CD001367,The optimal duration of oral anticoagulation therapy after a first episode of venous thromboembolism is still unclear. We performed a multicenter trial comparing six weeks of oral anticoagulant treatment with six months of such therapy in patients who had had a second episode of venous thromboembolism. The results showed a significant rate of recurrence in the group of patients receiving six months of anticoagulation. There was no difference in mortality or the rate of major hemorrhage between the six- and six-month groups.
59,CD001418,"Most clinical trials show a significant benefit of combination chemotherapy over single-agent chemotherapy. However, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of single-agent chemotherapy in treating advanced ovarian cancer. There is a need for more trials of high methodological quality."
60,CD001419,"Aduvant chemotherapy may offer a small benefit in the survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremity. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this treatment at a high quality. There is a risk of cardiotoxicity, which may explain why there is limited evidence for a benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with extremity sarcoma."
61,CD001431,"There is evidence that decision aids can improve patient decision making. In particular, there is evidence that DAs can improve the quality of health care. There is a requirement for large scale RCTs of these decision aids to confirm the preliminary results from this review."

63,CD001487,"There is no evidence of effect of PTFE on primary patency and secondary patency for above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafts. There is a risk of myocardial infarction and mortality in the PTFE group. In comparison to non-cuffed grafts, there is no significant difference in primary patency or limb salvage for HBD and PTFE."
64,CD001490,"Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be a useful adjunct to other therapies for patients with moderate to severe asthma. However, it does not appear to be effective for reducing hospitalisation and improving expiratory flow. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of magnesium in the treatment of asthma."
65,CD001539,"The addition of an audiotape to a primary cancer consultation increases patient satisfaction, knowledge of information given, and satisfaction with the consultation. This results from a small study. The use of a AUDIOTAPE to provide information about cancer is effective in terms of lower patient satisfaction, knowledge of information given, and satisfaction with the consultation."
66,CD001543,"There is evidence that Shouldice repair is superior to Bassini or Lichtenstein repair in terms of duration of operation, pain, complications and time to resumption of usual activities. Patients in the Shouldice repair group had less pain, less complications and a smaller number of rec"
67,CD001691,Early high-dose phenobarbital treatment is associated with an increased incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and may reduce the risk of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in preterm infants. The use of prophylactic phenobarbital to reduce motor activity and intraventricular hemorrhage is not justified.
68,CD001694,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of furosemide for preterm infants with chronic lung disease. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
69,CD001705,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a sliding-screw-plate for displaced femoral neck fractures. Where possible, patients should be treated with compression."
70,CD001715,This review provides some evidence to show that sertindole is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is not clear that the benefits of sertindole are significant compared to other antipsychotic agents. It is not clear that the risk of EPS is significant.
71,CD001782,"Topical tretinoin appears to be effective for the treatment of photoaging. However, there is a risk of side effects such as pyloric stenosis and peri-oral rhytides. 
Further well designed randomised controlled trials should be conducted in settings where several individuals perform the procedures."
72,CD001815,"Oral erythromycin appears to be effective in reducing the time taken to establish full enteral feedings in preterm infants with feeding intolerance. However, there is no evidence of effect in reducing the incidence of gastric residuals and cholestasis. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of erythromycin compared to placebo, which is at present unclear. There is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of erythromycin compared to no drug or placebo, which is at present unclear. Further high quality, fully powered trials are required to confirm the trends of effectiveness identifed in studies so far"
73,CD001831,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antitussive drugs for the treatment of cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection. Cough may be a useful adjunct to other respiratory infections, but should be treated with caution.
There is no evidence to support the use of antitussive drugs for the treatment of cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection."

There is no evidence that the use of peritonsillar infiltration with local anesthetics reduces pain after tonsillectomy.
75,CD001878,"Spinal manipulation is a common alternative therapy for headaches, but its efficacy compared with standard medical therapies is unknown. There is some evidence to suggest that placebo influences are slightly significant, with sex, social class and subjects' optimism about the therapist at the initial treatment being weakly associated with initial improvement."
76,CD001896,There is evidence that LPSN is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of dysmenorrhea and in reducing the risk of recurrence of menstrual pain in women with endometriosis. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.
77,CD001900,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of REM in patients with refractory epilepsy. Where possible, the trial should be continued and any small increases in plasma CBZ concentration should be mitigated."
78,CD001939,"Branched-chain amino acids appear to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic liver failure, branched-chain amino acids are associated with a significant improvement in psychomotor disturbances. The changes in neuropsychologic function were associated with an improvement in semiquantitative nitrogen balance, which became consistently positive in amino acid-treated subjects. There was also a mild improvement in nutritional parameters and in liver function tests. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes."
79,CD001943,"Loxapine appears to be similar to other neuroleptics in terms of efficacy and side effects. There is no clear evidence from this review as to whether or not it has advantages over other neuroleptics in treating psychoses. In acute schizophrenia, loxapine appears to be similar to other neuroleptics in terms of efficacy and side effects."
80,CD001946,We found no clear evidence to support the use of propranolol for the treatment of akathisia. It should be decided whether this can be extrapolated to other clinical settings.
81,CD001983,"Corticosteroid therapy may be effective for preventing bone loss in patients with RA when used prophylactically. However, there is insufficient evidence to support a role for calcitonin in this treatment. There is a risk of new fractures in the groups treated with calcitonin. In patients with rheumatic disease, corticosteroid therapy alone is associated with a greater incidence of fracture than no therapy. However, there is no evidence of a difference in the rate of vertebral fracture when using corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis."
82,CD001984,"There is evidence from one trial that applied relaxation can reduce pain, and that the addition of an operant programme does not improve pain reductions, but does tend to improve results with activity and especially medicine intake. There is no evidence that the addition of a cognitive component to the educational intervention increases the effectiveness of this intervention, but it is possible. There is no evidence that the addition of a cognitive component to the educational intervention increases the effectiveness of this intervention, but it is possible."
83,CD001998,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of placenta previa in women with hospitalisation due to vaginal bleeding. In the absence of evidence to support the routine administration of placenta previa in women with hospitalisation, should women prefer to undergo in-patient management."
84,CD002008,"The use of nutritional support for patients with cancer is effective in terms of reduced mortality, and improved quality of life. However, there is insufficient information regarding the impact of nutritional support on health and quality of life in outpatients receiving radiotherapy. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
85,CD002009,Once daily tobramycin treatment is safe and effective for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis. There is no evidence of adverse effects on long term health.
86,CD002037,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimens for people with HIV. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimens for people with HIV compared to a less intensive regimens that contained fewer drugs and had similar efficacy."
87,CD002047,"Methotrexate and leflunomide are effective in the treatment of RA. With limited data on other antirheumatic drugs, these drugs may not be as effective as leflunomide. With limited data on other antirheumatic drugs, these drugs may not be as effective as leflunomide. Short-term treatment with leflunomide may improve symptoms, signs and joint function. Long-term treatment with leflunomide and methotrexate may improve radiological progression."
88,CD002053,Adding clonidine to standard opioid therapy for detoxification from in utero exposure to methadone or heroin reduces the duration of opioid therapy and may reduce hospital cost. There is no evidence for or against the use of this adjunct therapy for neonatal abstinence.
89,CD002055,"Colloid infusions may be effective in reducing hypotension in preterm infants. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this treatment at a clinical level. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."

97,CD002179,There is no high quality evidence that oxatomide has an effective effect for children with asthma. There is limited evidence that the levels of eosinophil cationic protein and total asthma symptom scores are significantly reduced after treatment with oxatomide. There is no evidence that the rate of bronchodilatation or the intensity of wheezing is reduced after treatment with oxatomide.
98,CD002200,There is no evidence that the frequency of follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer after surgery is improved. There is a limited evidence that the rate of recurrence is reduced in patients with less intensive follow-up.
99,CD002208,"Discrepancies between studies and different settings are common, although reasons for these are not discussed in the review. This review does not cover the differences between different maintenance programs or between different doses of methadone, which is the most commontenance dose and is associated with the most retention."
100,CD002214,"There is little evidence to suggest that the use of nurse-led care reduces hospital stay, length of stay or functional dependence. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised trials on this topic."
101,CD002217,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between phenytoin and carbamazepine for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
102,CD002224,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of groin radiation in patients with carcinoma of the vulva. This review provides some evidence to show that the risk of groin relapses is higher in patients with squamous carcinoma of the vulva compared to groin dissection.
103,CD002230,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about the effectiveness of inotropic drugs in chronic heart failure did not change.

217,CD004181,"There is evidence that HAV vaccine is effective for a short period of time and that post-exposure prophylaxis with immune globulin may provide similar protection. However, the data on HAV vaccine and globulin may not be interpretable due to the differing methodologies employed in the studies and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of different doses of ISG and to examine whether there are differences between ISG and globulin."
218,CD004185,"Compared to SSRIs, fluoxetine is an efficacious but not perfect treatment for major depressive disorder. The beneficial effects of fluoxetine on sleep and anxiety are unclear. In patients with depressive disorder, SSRIs are associated with considerable adverse effects on physical and mental health. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing SSRIs with other antidepressants."

221,CD004207,"SnMP appears to be beneficial for the prevention of severe hyperbilirubinemia in full-term breastfed newborns with high bilirubin levels. In addition, it significantly reduces the use of PT and reduces the need for additional days of medical observation and bilirubin measurements. These results apply to preterm infants and to infants receivingphototherapy. The evidence produced by this review is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of SnMP in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia."
222,CD004214,Early weaning from the incubator to an open crib appears to be safe but may increase the risk of hypothermia. A review of the relevant studies is needed.
223,CD004217,There is evidence that DPNB is effective in reducing the pain of circumcision. There is no evidence that the use of local anesthesia is effective for neonatal circumcision. There is evidence that the use of DPNB is associated with smaller decreases in transcutaneous oxygen pressure levels and less time spent crying.
224,CD004219,There is no evidence to suggest that the use of CVC or peripheral intravenous catheters reduces the risk of sepsis or death in preterm infants.

In patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, cyclosporine is an effective single- therapy. In patients with severe ulcerative colitis who are unable to respond to corticosteroids, cyclosporine is an effective single- therapy. The beneficial effects of cyclosporine for patients with severe ulcerative colitis without steroids are clear."
226,CD004317,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of daily text-message reminders on the use of oral contraceptives. Although the lack of benefit may be attributed to the frequent use of alternative reminder systems, the rate of missed pills when measured objectively is still very high."
227,CD004362,"Although there is no high quality evidence that haloperidol is superior to lithium, or that the differences between them are significant, these data should be interpreted with caution. There is a case for the development and evaluation of haloperidol as a treatment for acute mania."
228,CD004366,There is evidence that exercise reduces depressive symptoms in people with mild to moderate depression. This results from a small study in which only a small number of participants were given exercise. There is no evidence that the reduction in depressive symptoms seen in the exercise group is statistically significant.
229,CD004376,"The previous version of this review showed that exercise resulted in a statistically significant improvement in pain, function and quality of life in people with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of people, exercise does not increase the risk of acute pain and may reduce the need for medication. Exercise may offer important improvements in patients' pain, function and quality of life."
230,CD004381,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of social stories to modify behaviors in students with autism. The evidence is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes.

It is clear from the literature that biofeedback can be used as a adjunct to physical therapy to improve muscle strength in patients with stroke.
242,CD004604,"Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of acute pain following oral surgery. Rofecoxib appears to be similar to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in terms of analgesic effects and adverse effects. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic."

246,CD004685,"Treatment of tinea capitis in children is currently unclear. Griseofulvin has been the mainstay of treatment for many years, but newer antifungal agents are being used more frequently. In the absence of evidence of benefit of oral terbinafine compared to griseofulvin, itraconazole and griseofulvin, should be considered. Short-term treatment with terbinafine is effective in reducing mycologic symptoms and improving clinical outcomes. However, long-term treatment with terbinafine and griseofulvin is required due to the high toxicity of these"

251,CD004751,"There is evidence that laparoscopy is associated with a smaller operative time, less pain, and a shorter hospital stay than laparotomy. Women with adnexal cysts without endometriotic tumour complications are more satisfied with laparoscopy, and the results suggest that the technique is associated with a lower incidence of complications and a smaller mean hospitalisation than laparotomy. However, there is no evidence that the rate of intraperitoneal spillage is reduced, and there is no evidence that the rate of bilateral pain is reduced. laparoscopy appears to be more effective than minilaparotomy"
252,CD004787,The other 57 patients only received liver resection. The high spontaneous 1-year survival rate of untreated patients was probably due to the exclusion of the most severely ill patients. Our results do not support the use of this method of chemoembolisation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
253,CD004791,There is evidence that primary prophylaxis of ascitic fluid protein levels is effective in preventing the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

256,CD004873,"We found no evidence regarding the effectiveness of CPT in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. In view of the modest number of patients included in the studies, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from CPT in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis."
257,CD004878,"Corticosteroids are used for treating acute bronchiolitis in two different doses: oral corticosteroids (1 mg) and oral dexamethasone (0.5 mg). The latter is more effective than oral corticosteroids in reducing respiratory rate, decreasing the use of accessory muscle, and reducing the risk of chronic bronchiolitis. However, there is no evidence of effect of corticosteroids on clinical outcomes."

They may be a useful treatment for acute humeral shaft fractures. However, there is a higher rate of non-union in the IMN group compared to the PLT group. There is a risk of shortening of the arm and shoulder due to the nail being inserted. However, this does not apply to the nails alone."
315,CD006002,"We found no clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of interferon-alpha for chronic hepatitis D. In patients with chronic hepatitis D, interferon is associated with a significant reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) levels. This may be a useful means of controlling the disease. However, long-term treatment with interferon is not possible due to the high attrition bias, the small number of participants and the short follow-up. Further trials should clarify the long-term effects of interferon in chronic hepatitis D and determine the optimal dose and frequency of treatment."

319,CD006097,"Natalizumab appears to be similar to placebo in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with moderately to moderately active Crohn's disease. In comparisons with placebo, natalizumab results in similar rates of response and remission and a similar level of C-reactive protein levels. However, each randomised trial identified represents a different clinical setting in Crohn's disease and the evidence base is limited. Consequently these data should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence becomes available. The aim of natalizumab is to prevent the leukocytes from migrating into the parenchyma and to prevent the immune"
