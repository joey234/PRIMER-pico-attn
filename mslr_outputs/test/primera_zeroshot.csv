0,CD000024,"[Prevention of deep venous thrombosis of the leg by a very low molecular weight heparin fraction (CY 222) in patients with hemiplegia following cerebral infarction: a randomized pilot study (30 patients)]. The effectiveness and safety of a very low molecular weight heparin fraction were evaluated in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis in patients confined to bed due to hemiplegia consecutive to a recent cerebral infarction. CY 222 was administered within 48 hours of the stroke by one single daily subcutaneous injection of 0.6 ml (= 15,000 U AXa IC) during 14 days. No deep-vein thrombosis was detected by the labelled fibrinogen test in the treated group, as against 12 patients in the control group. At post-mortem, 9.9% of the strokes were haemorrhagic (4 in the treatment and 3 in the control group). Low-dose calcium heparin given subcutaneously following acute stroke reduced the number of deep-vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli and deaths without increasing the number of haemorrhagic strokes in this study.Intravenous heparin for the prevention of"

2,CD000116,"Previous studies indicate that analysis of the ST waveform of the fetal electrocardiogram provides information on the fetal response to hypoxia. We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that intrapartum monitoring with cardiotocography combined with automatic ST-waveform analysis results in an improved perinatal outcome compared with cardiotocography alone. At three Swedish labour wards, 4966 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labour after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal cardiotocography. There was a trend towards fewer operative interventions for presumed fetal distress in the time-interval analysis plus cardiotocography group (63 [13%] vs 78 [16%]), but this was not significant (relative risk 0.80 [95% CI 0.59-1.08], p=0.17). There was no significant difference between groups in the proportion of babies who had an umbilical arterial pH of 7.15 or less (51 [11%] vs 49 [11%]; 1.01 [0.7-1.47]), or in the frequency of unsuspected acidaemia (42 [9%] vs 35 ["

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects, in patients with intermittent claudication. After a baseline period of 6 weeks, 62 patients were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, either placebo (31 patients) or policosanol (31), 10 mg twice daily. Walking distances in a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees) were assessed before and after 6 months of treatment. At 6 months, the mean pain-free walking distance had increased 90 meters (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64 to 116 meters; P <0.005) more in the simvastatin group than in the placebo group. Similar results were seen for the total walking distance (mean between-group difference in the change, 126 meters; 95% CI: 101 to 151 meters; P <0.001), and for the ankle-brachial index at rest (mean, 0.09; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.12; P <0.01) and"

A series of 80 patients with cervical, trochanteric or subtrochanteric hip fractures were randomized to either treatment without traction, skin traction, or skeletal traction during the 1883 h between admission and operation. The institution of skin or skeletal traction was not particularly painful for the patient, but we found no indication that either was of discernible benefit. The number of analgesic medications needed was no higher in patients without traction.. Preoperative skin traction for hip fracture: a randomized comparison between skin and skeletal traction in 78 patients. 153 consecutive patients with displaced cervical and trochanteric hip fractures were considered for inclusion in this study. 75 were excluded because of senile confusion and the remaining 78 were randomized to skeletal or skin traction preoperatively. The effect on pain alleviation was evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and by the number of doses of analgesics administered.

9,CD000246,"Adjunctive clindamycin therapy for preterm labor: a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of ampicillin-amoxicillin and erythromycin (administered for 3 days intravenously and 4 days orally) among hospitalized women with preterm labor at less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation who were treated with tocolytics. One hundred three woman-perinate pairs were analyzed. Univariate analysis demonstrated that pregnancies were continued longer in women treated with clindamycin than in women who received placebo (clindamycin-treated group, 35 days; placebo-treated group, 25 days; p = 0.02). No significant difference between the antibiotic group and the placebo group was found in maternal outcomes, including duration of randomization-to-delivery interval, frequency of preterm delivery (< 37 weeks), frequency of preterm premature rupture of membranes, clinical chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and number of subsequent admissions for preterm labor.

Self-reported cold data have been analyzed for 95 pairs of identical twins aged 14-64 who took part in a double-blind trial of vitamin C tablets. One member of each twin pair took a tablet containing 1 g vitamin C and the other took a well-matched placebo each day for 100 days. In the total sample there was no effect of vitamin C in preventing colds. However, subdivision of the data showed a significant preventive effect of the placebo in the 51 pairs living together and an equal and opposite preventive effect of the vitamin C in the 44 pairs living apart. The placebo effect in the pairs living together may be attributed to the large proportion who wrongly perceived which treatment they were taking.. Vitamin C and acute illness in Navajo school children. To evaluate earlier observations, including our own, showing usefulness of vitamin C for managing the common cold, we performed a double-blind trial of vitamin C versus placebo in 868 children.

After a run in period of six months patients were randomly given the book, the tape, both the book and tape, or neither. Patients' knowledge of the use of drugs, perceptions of their disability, skill in using an inhaler, consumption of drugs, consultations with their general practitioners, morbidity (from patients' entries on diary cards), and use of the educational material were measured. Knowledge about the use of drugs was significantly increased in the groups who received the material after three months and persisted after 12 months. Patients who had been given the tape or the book and tape increased their scores of knowledge of drugs more than patients given the book alone. Patients in all groups given the material considered that their disability was reduced. There were no other significant changes. Patients given both the book and the tape preferred the book. The paradoxical result whereby patients learnt more from the tape but preferred the book suggests that a distinction can be made between information that patients need, which may be acquired better from an audiocassette, and information that they want, which may be acquired better from a book.."

In a randomized prospective trial, we studied the effect of early high-dose phenobarbital treatment on the early (intraventricular hemorrhage) and late (neurodevelopmental abnormalities) manifestations of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in preterm infants weighing 1500 g or less at birth. The first intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg was given at a mean age of 110 minutes, followed by 15 mg/kg after 4 hours and then by 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals for 5 days. The overall incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was 32% in treated and 46% in control infants, a nonsignificant difference. An ultrasound brain scan at 9 months old revealed no significant difference in the incidence of ventricular dilatation between treated (19%) and control (29%) infants. At 27 months, a similar incidence of mild (10%) and severe (10%) neurodevelopmental handicaps was found in both treated and control groups. Since beneficial effects could not be documented by any of the criteria used, we conclude that routine administration of phenobarbital to low birth weight infants"

Sertindole is a novel antipsychotic agent with high selectivity for the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway and nanomolar affinities for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2, and norepinephrine NE alpha 1 receptors.. This study assessed time to treatment failure with 24 mg/day sertindole or 10 mg/day haloperidol in 282 clinically stable neuroleptic-responsive outpatients with schizophrenia. During a 5-week transition period, patients were randomized to treatment with sertindole or haloperidol; other treatments were gradually discontinued. Time to treatment failure was numerically superior in sertindole-treated patients compared with haloperidol-treated patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. Sertindole-treated patients, however, remained free of hospitalization for exacerbation of schizophrenia and remained medically compliant significantly longer than did haloperidol-treated patients. In addition, there were significantly fewer reports of EPS in sertindole-treated patients and sertindole therapy was generally well tolerated."

94,CD002113,"A clinical trial of a behavioral therapy to reduce urinary incontinence in nursing homes. Outcome and implications. One hundred thirty-three incontinent women in seven nursing homes were assigned randomly to a 13-week behavior therapy program for urinary incontinence or to a control group that received usual incontinence-related care. The therapy became effective after 6 weeks of training. By the final month of training, the treatment women's wet episodes had been reduced by 0.6 episodes per day, a 26% reduction over baseline. This reduction in the number of wet episodes was statistically significant, both with respect to this group's baseline levels of incontinence and in comparison with the performance of the control women. The number of wet episodes in the control group remained about the same throughout training and the 22-week follow-up period. The treatment women improved partly because they learned to request help, a response prompted and reinforced by the program. Trainees with a high frequency of incontinence during baseline, the more cognitively intact residents, and residents with normal bladder capacity responded better to this behavior therapy program.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a low-technology environment of care and a nurse case management case delivery system (special care unit, SCU) with the traditional high-technology environment (ICU) and primary nursing care delivery system on the patient outcomes of length of stay, mortality, readmission, complications, satisfaction, and cost. A sample of 220 chronically critically ill patients were randomly assigned to either the SCU (n = 145) or the ICU (n = 75). Few significant differences were found between the two groups in length of stay, mortality, or complications. However, the findings showed significant cost savings in the SCU group in the charges accrued during the study period and in the charges and costs to produce a survivor. The average total cost of delivering care was $5,000 less per patient in the SCU than in the traditional ICU. In addition, the cost to produce a survivor was $19,000 less in the SCU. Results from this 4-year clinical trial demonstrate that nurse case managers in a SCU setting can produce patient outcomes equal to or better than those in the traditional ICU care environment for long-term"

A total of 57 patients were randomized to the thrombolytic therapy group, and 57 patients were randomized to the operative therapy group. Thrombolytic therapy resulted in dissolution of the occluding thrombus in 40 (70%) patients. Although the cumulative limb salvage rate was similar in the two treatment groups (82% at 12 months), the cumulative survival rate was significantly improved in patients randomized to the thrombolysis group (84% vs 58% at 12 months, p = 0.01). The benefits of thrombolysis were achieved without significant differences in the duration of hospitalization (median 11 days) and with only modest increases in hospital cost in the thrombolytic treatment arm (median $15,672 vs $12,253, p = 0.02). Intraarterial thrombolytic therapy was associated with a reduction in the incidence of in-hospital cardiopulmonary complications and a corresponding increase in patient survival rates.

Thirteen patients with moderately severe myasthenia gravis participated in a double-blind study using either 100 mg of prednisone or an equivalen numbder of placebo tablets on alternate days. At the end of 6 months the code was broken. Seven patients were on placebo and three of these had improved to such a degree that steroid therapy was not indicated. Four of these patients ultimately were started on prednisone and improved. Of the six patients on prednisone, three showed no improvement and three were improved. At the end of 2 years, the seven patients still taking prednisone were on maintenance dosage of this drug. Three of this group had experienced relapses when the dosage was cut to 15 to 25 mg on alternate days, and they again improved when the prednisone dosage was increased. No statistical evaluation is possible because of the small number of patients. It can be stated that seven patients improved with steroid therapy. Conversely, not all patients treated with alternate-day prednisone improved. Finally, any evaluation of treatment of myasthenia gravis must take into consideration the potential for spontaneous improvement, as demonstrated by three of the patients treated with placebo."

Female intervention students rated their physical appearance as perceived by others significantly higher than control students and allowed their body weight to increase appropriately by preventing the age increase in weight-losing behaviors of the control students. One year after the intervention, body image and attitude changes were still present. These findings also held for the 116 students (63% females) with low self-esteem and higher anxiety, who were considered at risk for the development of eating disorders. These students also had significantly lower drive for thinness and greater body satisfaction following the intervention"

The objective was to investigate whether acupuncture could be a reasonable option for augmentation in labor after spontaneous rupture of membranes at term and to look for possible effects on the progress of labor. In a randomized controlled trial 100 healthy parturients, with spontaneous rupture of membranes at term, were assigned to receive either acupuncture or no acupuncture. The main response variables were the duration of active labor, the amount of oxytocin given, and number of inductions. Duration of labor was significantly reduced (mean difference 1.7 h, p=0.03) and there was significant reduction in the need for oxytocin infusion to augment labor in the study group compared to the control group (odds ratio 2.0, p=0.018). We also discovered that the participants in the acupuncture group who needed labor induction had a significantly shorter duration of active phase than the ones induced in the control group (mean difference 3.6 h, p=0.002). Acupuncture may be a good alternative or complement to pharmacological methods in the effort to facilitate birth and provide normal delivery for women with prelabor rupture of membranes.."

Troleandomycin (TAO), a macrolide antibiotic, was studied as an alternative treatment in 18 children with severe, steroid-requiring asthma. In this investigation three treatment arms were used in randomized, double-blind, parallel fashion: combination TAO and methylprednisolone (MPn), combination TAO and prednisone, and MPn alone. All groups tolerated a considerable reduction in glucocorticoid dose over the 12 weeks of the study: 80% +/- 6% for TAO-MPn, 55% +/- 8% for TAO-prednisone, and 44% +/- 14% for MPn alone. These reductions are all statistically significant (p < 0.05) within groups, and the differences between groups were statistically significant between the TAO-MPn and MPn alone groups. Low-dose TAO combined with MPn has a significant effect on methylprednisolone clearance in children, an effect equivalent to that reported with higher dose TAO (1000 mg/d) therapy. In addition, this preliminary study suggests that TAO may decrease bronchial hyper"

Fifty boys presenting for day case circumcision were allocated randomly to receive either caudal analgesia or dorsal nerve block (DNB) to provide postoperative pain relief. Analgesia was assessed by a single, unbiased observer utilising a three-point scale. Subsequently, parents completed a simple questionnaire. There was no difference between the groups in time to first requirement for analgesia or number of doses of paracetamol given in the first 24 h. Almost half the boys in the caudal group had motor weakness, and there was a significant increase in time to first micturition in that group. There was no difference between the groups in PONV, eating, sleeping or behavioural disturbance. Caudal anaesthesia with bupivacaine/ketamine does not confer any advantage over a dorsal nerve block with the doses used in this study. Because of the higher incidence of side-effects and technique failure in the caudal group, dorsal nerve block is perhaps the preferred technique.."

Weekly reports of high-risk indicators designed to monitor the course of treatment were obtained from physically abused, school-aged children and their parents/guardians who were randomly assigned to Individual Child and Parent Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment (CBT) or Family Therapy (FT). Between 20% and 23% of the two informant's reports acknowledged high levels of physical discipline/force during the early and late phases of treatment, respectively, and an even higher percentage of cases reported heightened parental anger and family problems. Early treatment reports from both informants predicted late period reports, but only parent reports were related to validity measures. The overall levels of parental anger and physical discipline/force were lower in CBT than FT families, though each group showed a reduction on these items from the early to late treatment sessions.. The lack of demonstrated effect on children may reflect the need for a larger and more sustained treatment dose and/or the need to include parent-child interaction opportunities in the program.

After weaknesses were identified in the hospital's system for reporting and evaluating medication errors, a multidisciplinary task force was formed to redesign the hospital's medication error-reporting system. Its guiding principles were as follows: anonymity and freedom from punitive action are essential for increasing the number of reports, rating medication errors facilitates identification of areas for system improvement, potential errors provide valuable insight into the system's vulnerabilities, and timely review of reports enables rapid systematic correction. To support the intended nonpunitive culture, the term medication-use variance was used in lieu of medication error for any unplanned event that deviates from the intended course of prescribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring medications. The most difficult decision for the task force was deciding whether the process should be anonymous. After getting the support of the medical-legal counsel and the quality improvement department for an anonymous reporting process, the task force agreed to test it in the department of pharmacy and in three patient units in September 1998.

318,CD006069,"A multicenter, randomized, masked, comparison trial of lucinactant, colfosceril palmitate, and beractant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome among very preterm infants. Evidence suggests that synthetic surfactants consisting solely of phospholipids can be improved through the addition of peptides, such as sinapultide, that mimic the action of human surfactant protein-B (SP-B). A synthetic surfactant containing a mimic of SP-B may also reduce the potential risks associated with the use of animal-derived products. Therefore, we compared lucinactant (Surfaxin; Discovery Laboratories, Doylestown, PA) with porcine-derived, poractant alfa (Curosurf; Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) in a trial to test for noninferiority. A total of 252 infants born between 24 and 28 weeks of completed gestation, with birth weights between 600 and 1250 g, were assigned randomly in a multicenter, multinational, noninferiority, randomized, controlled study to receive either lucinactant (n = 124) or poractant alfa (n = 128) within 30 minutes of"

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the alpha4 integrin-specific humanized monoclonal antibody natalizumab in 248 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: two infusions of placebo; one infusion of 3 mg of natalizumab per kilogram of body weight, followed by placebo; two infusions of 3 mg of natalizumab per kilogram; or two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram. Outcomes included changes in scores for the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (higher scores indicate more severe disease), the health-related quality of life, and C-reactive protein levels. The group given two infusions of 6 mg of natalizumab per kilogram did not have a significantly higher rate of clinical remission (defined by a score of less than 150 on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index) than the placebo group at week 6 (the prospectively"

The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) measured over 12 h after 12 wk of treatment. Patients were stratified on the basis of bronchodilator response to albuterol (> 12% and > 200-ml improvement) and were randomized within each stratum. Salmeterol provided similar maximal bronchodilatation to ipratropium but had a longer duration of action and a more constant bronchodilatory effect with no evidence of bronchodilator tolerance. Analyses of time to first COPD exacerbation revealed salmeterol to be superior to placebo and ipratropium (p < 0.05). These collective data support the use of salmeterol as first-line bronchodilator therapy for the long-term treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with"

328,CD006194,"We report the results of a prospective randomised controlled trial of the management of 101 Colles' fractures in patients over the age of 55 years. Within two weeks of initial reduction 43 fractures had displaced with either more than 10 degrees dorsal angulation or more than 5 mm radial shortening. These patients were randomly divided into two groups: 21 were remanipulated and held by an external fixator; in the control group of 22 patients, the redisplacement was accepted and conservative treatment was continued. Patients treated with external fixation had a good anatomical result, but their function was no better than that of the control group. We found no correlation between final anatomical and functional outcome, and concluded that the severity of the original soft-tissue injury and its complications are the major determinants of functional end result. Fractures of the distal end of the radius are common injuries and are the commonest bony injury around the wrist. Management of these fractures has remained controversial as far as modality of treatment is concerned. In this study 90 adult cases of acute displaced intra-articular fractures of the lower end of the radius were classified according to Frykman's and AO classifications after obtaining radiographs in antero-posterior and lateral planes.

331,CD006251,"Impact of the OSHA trench and excavation standard on fatal injury in the construction industry. In 1989 the US Occupational Safety & Health Administration revised the excavation and trenching standard. We examined fatal injuries from trench cave-in in the construction industry for five year periods before and after the revision in the 47 US states for which data were available for both periods. There was a 2-fold decline in the rate of fatal injury after revision of the standard, which substantially exceeded the decline in other causes of fatal injury in the construction industry during the same period. The decline was somewhat greater in large business firms but was evident in construction firms of all size classes. The fatality rate from trench cave-in in union construction workers was approximately half that of nonunion workers, but we were unable to determine whether this was best explained by union status, employment of union workers at larger construction firms, or both..

Seroconversion rates after two doses of vaccine were 57.1 to 84.6% and seroresponse rates were between 24 and 60% in children with ALL. Compared to children with asthma in remission, who were regarded as immunocompetent individuals, the ALL children had less seroconversion and lower seroresponse rates to A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1). The seroconversion and seroresponse rates to B/Yamanashi/166/98 and A/ Panama/2007/99(H3N2) antigens were comparable in asthmatic and leukemic children. On the other hand, the antibody response in children with ALL who received reinduction chemotherapy suggests that the therapy did not impair seroresponse rates.

To evaluate the efficacy of a community-based intervention targeting symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in formerly abducted individuals. Thirty-six sexually abused children (aged 5-17 years) were randomly assigned to a child-alone cognitive-behavioral treatment condition, a family cognitive-behavioral treatment condition, or a waiting-list control condition. Compared with controls, children who received treatment exhibited significant improvements in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and self-reports of fear and anxiety. Significant improvements also occurred in relation to parent-completed measures and clinician ratings of global functioning. In general, parental involvement did not improve the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Maintenance of improvement was evident at a 12-week follow-up assessment. Cognitive-behavioral treatment was useful, but further research is required on caregiver involvement.

Most of them pointed out there was no difference in survival between residual disease of 0.1-1 cm (R1) and >1 cm (R2). The median survival of the entire cohort was 31.7 months, with an estimated 5-year survival of 31.1%. The median survival and estimated 5-year survival for patients with R1 were 31.1 months and 23.9%, and there were significant differences in survival when compared to 15.6 months and 6.4% in R2 (chi(2) = 7.45, P = 0.006), 63.2 months (mean survival) and 54.4% in complete cytoreduction (chi(2) = 8.93, P = 0.0028).

441,CD008838,"The treatment of patients allergic to insect stings with insect-venom injections has been shown to be 97 percent effective in reducing the risk of sting-induced anaphylaxis. However, the frequency of systemic reactions to subsequent stings in unimmunized adults with previous reactions is approximately 60 percent. To determine which factors, in addition to a history of reaction and evidence of venom-specific IgE antibody, predispose patients to future insect-sting reactions, we studied a venom-sensitive group of children who were deemed to be at relatively low risk for severe reactions; 28 percent of them received venom therapy. We studied 242 children, 2 through 16 years of age, each of whom had had a systemic allergic reaction, affecting only the skin, to an insect sting. Each child had a positive skin-test reaction to one or more of five hymenopteran venoms. Sixty-eight children received immunotherapy with insect venom and 174 did not; about half were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and the rest were assigned on the basis of the patient's (or the parents') choice The results of accidental stings during four years of observation were evaluated. In the treated group, 84 stings in 36 patients resulted in one systemic reaction (1.2 percent"
