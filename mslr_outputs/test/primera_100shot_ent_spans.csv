CD000024,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin for prevention of deep-vein thrombosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients with acute ischemic stroke are at high risk of developing pulmonary embolism or death. It is proposed that patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with heparin should be offered entry into a clinical trial.
CD000074,"We found some limited evidence of effects of theophylline on short-term outcomes in infants with apnea. However, the data were not statistically significant and it was not clear whether theophylline had an effect on long-term outcomes."
CD000116,"There is no evidence of effect of ST analysis on outcomes in labour, and there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of ST analysis in neonatal outcomes. However, it is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for practice. There is a need to develop more robust trials to compare cardiotocography with other means of intrapartum monitoring, such as ST analysis alone."
CD000123,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of policosanol for improving walking distances in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease, and in reducing the incidence of major events such as stroke. However, the data suggest that the drug may reduce the risk of major events such as stroke, and may reduce the incidence of very severeClaudication. However, the data on atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis did not show a significant effect on walking distances in patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease."
CD000143,"There is no evidence of effect of NCPAP on respiratory function in preterm infants compared to other CPAPs, and there is a limited evidence of the benefit of NCPAP on respiratory function in infants with acute and chronic respiratory distress. However, there is a significant risk of atelectasis with the use of NCPAP, and there is a possibility of increased need for reintubation. The risk of respiratory acidosis is increased with NCPAP, and there is a possible benefit of increased NCPAP use in preventing respiratory acidosis. However, there is no evidence of the benefit of NCPAP on"
CD000146,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of nicotine patches for smoking cessation. In clinical practice, most of the trials were done in settings where several people provide the advice and support needed to support a smoker's decision to stop smoking. However, a few studies, such as the one on the tobacco dependence outcomes in children, showed that the risk of relapse following use of nicotine patches is less than that of drugs such as dopamine agonists or oral nicotine patches. However, many of the trials were done in settings where several people provide the advice and support needed to support a smoker's decision to stop smoking."
CD000168,"We found no evidence of benefit from skin traction on hip fractures compared to other immobilisation methods, and no evidence of benefit from traction on cervical or trochanteric hip fractures compared to other immobilisation methods. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of skin traction on proximal femoral fractures in alleviating pain, as this could be used in post-operative care. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of skin traction on proximal femoral fractures in alleviating pain."
CD000220,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of metronidazole for the prevention of preterm labour and in particular, of the risk of preterm labour in women with trichomoniasis. In view of the modest number of women studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if metronidazole is effective in preventing preterm labour and in preventing the risk of early labour in women with trichomoniasis."
CD000238,There is limited evidence to suggest that supplemental oxygen increases the rate of desaturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild hypoxemia. There is no evidence that the use of supplemental oxygen increases the rate of desaturation in patients with severe COPD.
CD000246,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of ampicillin-amoxycillin for the prevention of preterm labour in women with threatened idiopathic preterm labour. In addition to preventing preterm labour, ampicillin and amoxyclavulanic acid may reduce the risk of neonatal death, and may reduce the risk of serious neonatal complications. However, there is no evidence that ampicillin and amoxyclavulanic acid reduce the risk of serious neonatal complications, and further research is needed."
CD000254,"There is no high quality evidence that vitamin E supplementation increases the rate of visual function in people with age-related macular degeneration, and further research is needed."
CD000255,"There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies carotid artery dissection, and the manner in which it occurs is important. In addition to angiography, Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging are effective in identifying carotid artery dissections. The potential benefits of anticoagulation for carotid artery dissection are not clear, due to the high attrition bias, the small number of patients and the poor quality of the trials. However, anticoagulation with the caveat that all patients should be offered a choice of whether to use anticoagulation or not, and whether the initial treatment should be"
CD000259,"The use of practice-based feedback to improve the quality of primary care primary care is growing. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of practice-based feedback to improve the quality of primary care. [Note: The two studies in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"
CD000297,We found no clear evidence to support the use of cyclosporine for patients with active chronic Crohn's disease who are not responding to corticosteroids. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised clinical trials of high methodological quality in order to define the long-term effects of cyclosporine for patients with active chronic Crohn's disease.
CD000305,There is no high quality evidence that heparin is effective in preventing deep-vein thromboembolic disease in patients with hip fracture. There is a limited evidence that heparin is effective in preventing post-operative venous thromboembolic disease in patients with hip fracture. There is a limited evidence that heparin is effective in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in patients with hip fracture.
CD000345,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of interferon for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In patients with chronic hepatitis B, the risk of acute liver failure is high. With limited data on other factors, such as local guidelines and preferences, and lack of evidence in favour of other regimens, interferon may be a useful adjunct to corticosteroid therapy in preventing acute liver failure."
CD000369,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha for patients with acute post-transfusion hepatitis C. When used short term, interferon-alpha may reduce the risk of chronic hepatitis C by reducing the time taken for administration of the drug and improving the rate of response to therapy. However, there is no evidence to support the use of interferon-alpha for patients with acute post-transfusion hepatitis C at a low dose and with a long term benefit. The potential benefits of interferon-alpha for acute hepatitis C need to be evaluated in large scale studies along with long-term"
CD000405,"There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic oral vancomycin treatment reduces the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm, very low birthweight infants and that it may be effective in preventing the emergence of vancomycin resistant or dependent organisms. However, further trials are needed to confirm the results of this study and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of vancomycin."
CD000409,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of educational outreach visits to improve the practice of primary care. Implementation should be undertaken with caution and use of best available evidence.
CD000432,We found no clear evidence to support the use of caffeine for the prevention of hypoxaemic episodes in preterm infants. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour in this field.
CD000436,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of dietary salt for improvement in pulmonary function in people with asthma. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD000460,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ASA in the treatment of asthma. It should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD000479,"There is no evidence of effect of varicocele treatment on fertility in men with infertility. In one trial, there was a significant increase in the rate of pregnancy in the women receiving varicocele treatment, but there was no significant effect in the men receiving no treatment. The current evidence of effectiveness of varicocele treatment on fertility is limited due to the small number of participants in the study and the heterogeneity of the assessment."
CD000483,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of prophylactic hyperdynamic postoperative fluid therapy for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from prophylactic hyperdynamic postoperative fluid therapy."
CD000491,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of amoxycillin for the treatment of bacteriuria in pregnancy. In the absence of evidence to support the use of any specific regimens for bacteriuria in pregnancy, it is advisable to carry out randomised clinical trials on the regimens used in this review. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of amoxycillin for bacteriuria in pregnancy and the optimal regimens for treatment and to examine new therapies."
CD000525,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of zuclopenthixol acetate in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously.

CD000536,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of heparin as an anticoagulation during femoro-popliteal and femoro-distal bypass surgery. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods of anticoagulation, these trials should be interpreted with caution. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of heparin as an anticoagulation during femoro-popliteal and femoro-distal bypass surgery and to examine the relationship with other anticoagulation drugs such as anticoagulation prophylaxis and anticoagulation after bypass"
CD000567,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific type of resuscitative solution for intra-abdominal surgery. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD000934,We found no clear evidence to support the use of any specific visit schedules for antenatal care in low-risk women. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from reduced visit schedules for antenatal care in low risk women.
CD000948,There is insufficient evidence to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of intubation used in the treatment of preterm infants. Clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of different methods of intubation used in the treatment of preterm infants.
CD000972,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with cerebral malaria. When used high-dose, dexamethasone may be associated with a high rate of adverse events, particularly in the short term. Further high-dose dexamethasone treatment should be undertaken with caution in patients with malaria who are already undergoing treatment for other factors such as malaria-related pneumonia."
CD000978,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about lamotrigine's lack of efficacy in preventing oral mucositis did not change. Given availability of more effective treatments including amifostine and palifermin, amifostine's lack of efficacy in preventing oral mucositis and its possible benefits for preventing acute radiation-induced mucositis is at present a major injustice."
CD000980,"There is no evidence of effect of vitamin C prophylaxis on the incidence of common cold and other respiratory illnesses in people with atrophic gastritis. In the elderly, vitamin C supplementation may have a small benefit in reducing the incidence of respiratory infections. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin C prophylaxis in the treatment of common cold. In the elderly, vitamin C supplementation may have a small benefit in reducing the incidence of respiratory infections. However, the data on the children in the main studies were underpowered to detect uncommon colds. The data on the women in the smaller studies were not significantly"
CD000996,"There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the value of fluticasone for patients with bronchiectasis. Inhaled fluticasone therapy appears to be effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices and in reducing the frequency of exacerbations. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the lower eNO levels are associated with a reduction in bronchiectasis-related hospital admissions. Further high-quality, fully powered studies are required to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of fluticasone."
CD001005,We found some limited evidence of effects on knowledge of asthma symptoms and medication use in the education programs. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed studies in this field. There is a case for large randomized controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from the education programs on asthma management.
CD001018,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of HRT for prevention of postmenopausal breast and uterine cancer. In the absence of evidence to support or refute the use of HRT for prevention of postmenopausal breast and uterine cancer, and in the absence of evidence to support or refute the use of HRT for prevention of postmenopausal breast and uterine cancer, these data should be interpreted with caution. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in women with early postmenopausal osteoporosis who are wishing to preserve their fertility."
CD001024,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tamoxifen for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. In the absence of evidence to support the use of any specific type of therapy for HCC, this review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised clinical trials of high methodological quality."
CD001036,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of any of the sampling methods used in the review of cervical cancer screening programs. The review identified six new studies, most of them reporting on interventions not included in the original version. However, the conclusions of the review did not change."
CD001046,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of methylprednisolone for patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD001055,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of different smoking cessation programs for women in maternity care. In the absence of evidence to support or refute the use of any specific interventions for pregnant women, these studies should be interpreted with caution. The aim of a multimodal smoking cessation intervention regimen is to reduce the frequency of smoking, and thus the risk of smoking-related adverse events, in a population of women who are already smokers."
CD001059,"We found no clear evidence from the calcium supplementation studies to suggest a reduction in the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia and preterm birth. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised controlled trials of calcium supplementation in pregnancy to determine if there is a benefit from calcium supplementation compared to placebo."
CD001062,"The benefits of maternal antenatal decompression treatment for pre-eclampsia are unclear, due to the differing effects on different outcomes and outcomes. However, it is clear from the literature that decompression may be useful for preventing the adverse effects of pre-eclampsia."
CD001066,"There is no evidence of effect of reflexology on wellbeing in women with severe pedal edema, and there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of reflexology on oedema in pregnancy. However, there are insufficient data to support or refute the use of any specific reflexology technique for oedema, and further research is needed."
CD001069,There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of oral sucrose as an analgesic in the treatment of pain-related newborn infants in neonatal intensive care. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001073,There is no high quality evidence that D-penicillamine is effective in preventing ROP in preterm infants. There is a need for more trials of high methodological quality.
CD001112,"Although caffeine is an effective means of decreasing pulmonary complications in people with asthma, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is effective for treating asthma. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the effects of caffeine on asthma."
CD001162,"There is no high quality evidence that sulpiride is effective for treating acute schizophrenia, and there is limited evidence that the drug is effective for chronic schizophrenia. There is a limited evidence that the drug is effective for treating chronic schizophrenia, and there is limited evidence that the drug is effective for treating acute schizophrenia."
CD001168,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of the use of topical hyaluronic acid for the treatment of oral lichen planus. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods of treatment, this review was limited to comparisons of topical hyaluronic acid with other drugs such as corticosteroids or with no specific recommendations for the use of these drugs. The aim of the review was to provide evidence to support the use of topical hyaluronic acid for the treatment of oral lichen planus."
CD001261,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of Ty21a vaccine in the treatment of typhoid fever. In the absence of evidence to support the use of any specific type of vaccine for typhoid fever, clinicians and patients should recommend the routine administration of Ty21a in the form of a single dose. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of the Ty21a vaccine and the optimal dose and frequency of administration."
CD001266,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of albutamol for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in infants. In the absence of evidence to support the use of any specific type of albutamol for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis, this review provides evidence to support the use of albutamol as a primary therapy for bronchiolitis in preterm infants."
CD001275,There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the value of laser treatment for wound healing in patients with spinal cord injury. The use of a single laser treatment for a long term treatment of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury is effective.
CD001293,"School-based tobacco and substance use prevention programs can probably be more effective than interventions that focus on parents and older peers. However, the effectiveness of school-based tobacco and substance use prevention programs is less clear. In the absence of evidence from large scale randomized controlled trials, school-based tobacco and substance use prevention programs should be more cautiously designed."
CD001297,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of leuprolide as a therapy for endometriosis. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD001331,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone for patients with acute multiple sclerosis (MS) as a therapy for cognitive function. In patients with relapse, there is a significant decrease in clinical disability scores when used as a therapy for methylprednisolone compared to placebo. This effect is statistically significant and may be beneficial for patients with acute multiple sclerosis."
CD001332,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of the use of cotrimoxytam for spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. When used as a primary treatment, cotrimoxytam may have some advantages over placebo. However, when used as a primary treatment, cotrimoxytam may have some disadvantages. The availability of low-cost, high-quality treatments for spasticity in multiple sclerosis is lacking."
CD001340,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of ECMO as a therapy for newborn infants with respiratory failure. When used in a clinical setting, the treatment may be associated with a higher rate of death than other therapies. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in preterm infants with respiratory failure; or of high risk newborn infants with severe pulmonary hypertension. These trials should measure clinically important outcomes."
CD001342,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of warfarin as a primary prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with transient ischemic attack or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin. In the absence of evidence to support the use of any specific anticoagulation drugs for this purpose, this review was unable to recommend a specific drug for use in this situation. However, it should be recognised that the lack of evidence to support the routine administration of warfarin in this situation is a relevant issue for future randomised controlled trials."
CD001351,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in a similar population of patients, acupuncture may be effective for chronic low back pain without an increase in the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. However, there is insufficient evidence for or against other types of acupuncture in this situation and further research is needed."
CD001367,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of warfarin in the treatment of first episode venous thromboembolism. In the absence of evidence to support more than three months of anticoagulation in the situation, we recommend the continued use of warfarin in the situation. In patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism who are undergoing surgery for a first episode of venous thromboembolism, warfarin should be offered in addition to anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism who are undergoing surgery for"
CD001418,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in the absence of evidence from other regimens. cyclophosphamide alone may be useful in treating patients with advanced ovarian cancer without increasing the risk of acute leukemia. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in the absence of evidence from other regimens."
CD001419,"We are unable to give any clear recommendations for the use of doxorubicin as an adjuvant therapy for soft-tissue sarcoma. In view of the modest number of patients included in this review, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine the effectiveness of Adriamycin as an adjuvant therapy for high-grade sarcoma."
CD001431,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any decision-making aid for breast cancer screening. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001439,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific antibiotics for prophylaxis of acute non-perforated appendicitis. The use of any specific antibiotics for prophylaxis of acute non-perforated appendicitis is necessary, given the high incidence of wound infection following appendicitis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific antibiotics for prophylaxis of acute non-perforated appendicitis. In the absence of evidence to support more specific antibiotics, the review authors recommend the use of any antibiotic that is effective in preventing acute non-perforated appendicit"
CD001487,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of PTFE for femoropopliteal bypass surgery, and although there are prospective trials, insufficient data to recommend the immediate use of this graft.

CD001543,"There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies a hernia and, although repair methods are frequently used, there is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies a hernia. The best evidence to date is from a single trial that identified a significant benefit of Shouldice repair over Bassini-Kirschner in terms of lower recurrence rate, pain score and incidence of postoperative complications. However, there is no significant evidence for or against other repair methods. The available evidence is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the provision of shouldice- shouldice repair in the future."
CD001691,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of phenobarbital for prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. In view of the modest number of infants studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from the use of phenobarbital in preventing intraventricular hemorrhage."
CD001694,"We found no clear evidence from the furosemide studies on pulmonary mechanics in preterm infants with chronic lung disease and no evidence that the drug improved pulmonary function in these infants. However, the data on respiratory mechanics in preterm infants with chronic lung disease and no evidence of benefit from furosemide's anti-inflammatory effects were important to draw conclusions."
CD001705,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of closed reduction for displaced femoral neck fractures in adults. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods of treatment, the review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest technique available. Further randomised trials are warranted, preferably multi-centred trials. The classification of a displaced femoral neck fracture as closed and open reduction does not appear to be relevant to a successful clinical outcome."
CD001715,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of sertindole for patients with schizophrenia compared to other antipsychotic medications, or to assess the long-term effects of sertindole compared to other antipsychotic medications, or to assess the safety of sertindole compared to other antipsychotic medications. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised clinical trials of new antipsychotic agents in this field."
CD001782,"There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the value of topical tretinoin for the treatment of photoaging. In the treatment of photoaging, topical tretinoin appears to be similar to other topical tretinoin compounds in terms of efficacy and safety. However, there is a higher risk of adverse effects with higher concentrations of tretinoin, which may explain why the studies were not of high methodological quality. Further high quality, fully powered trials are required to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal concentrations of tretinoin that can be used in the treatment of photoaging."

CD001896,We found some limited evidence of benefit from presacral neurectomy in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in women with moderate to severe endometriosis. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of this type in women with endometriosis.
CD001900,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of CBZ in patients with refractory epilepsy. When used as a add-on to Tegretol, it may be advisable to carry out routine administration of CBZ at the lowest possible concentration. This would allow the careful analysis of any adverse effects that might result from the interaction of CBZ and REM."
CD001939,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific amino acids for treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis. The use of any specific amino acids for treatment of acute hepatic encephalopathy is not effective, based on one trial. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific amino acids for treatment of chronic encephalopathy in cirrhosis."
CD001943,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of loxapine as a treatment for schizophrenia. In patients with acute schizophrenia where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe any specific drug, loxapine may be a useful adjunct to dopamine agonists. In patients with chronic schizophrenia where clinicians feel it is safe not to prescribe any specific drug, loxapine may be a useful adjunct to dopamine agonists."
CD001946,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of propranolol as a primary treatment for akathisia in schizophrenia. In patients with NIA, propranolol appears to be similar to anticholinergic medication in terms of efficacy and safety, but the long-term safety data on this treatment is unknown. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the preliminary results from this review."
CD001983,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of calcitonin for preventing osteoporosis in patients with RA. In comparisons with placebo, calcitonin showed a small mean reduction in the rate of vertebral fracture, and there was no evidence for a difference in the rate of new fractures. However, high doses of calcitonin (100 IU daily) were seen in some patients, and although not significant, these data did not support the continued use of corticosteroid therapy in preventing osteoporosis. Further high quality, fully powered trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and"
CD001984,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of ECO for patients with FM, and the evidence is limited due to the small number of participants and the small number of included studies. However, it seems desirable to develop ECO in the context of a clinical trial. In addition to providing information about the pain management program, ECO may offer a useful adjunct to clinical trials. The potential benefits of ECO for patients with FM need to be evaluated in a large scale study along with long term follow-up."
CD001998,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine administration of corticosteroids in the treatment of symptomatic placenta previa. Inpatients with symptomatic placenta previa are less likely to experience a serious adverse outcome than patients with no previa, but there is a risk of bleeding during labour. As a treatment choice women with symptomatic placenta previa are less likely to experience a serious adverse outcome than women with no previa, but there is a risk of bleeding during labour."
CD002008,"There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the value of nutritional support for patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy. In the absence of evidence to support or refute the use of nutritional support, this review provides evidence to support or not support the use of nutritional support in a clinically meaningful manner."
CD002009,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of any specific regimens for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of once- and thrice-daily tobramycin treatment for pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis."
CD002037,induction therapy may be effective in reducing the risk of virologic failure in HIV-infected patients but there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use in preventing HIV-1 infection. maintenance therapy may be effective in reducing the risk of virologic failure in HIV-infected patients but there is insufficient evidence to recommend it in preventing HIV infection.
CD002047,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of leflunomide for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.

CD002053,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of DTO in the treatment of NOW. In infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, treatment with DTO is associated with less severe withdrawal than other opioid therapies. However, there is no evidence to support the continued use of DTO in the treatment of NOW. In infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, treatment with DTO is associated with less severe withdrawal than other opioid therapies. However, there is no evidence to support the continued use of DTO in the treatment of NOW."
CD002055,"There is no high quality evidence that dopamine/albumin exchange transfusion increases blood pressure oretry in preterm infants, and further research is needed."
CD002068,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pamidronate for treatment of bone metastases in women with breast cancer, and although the drug may be effective in reducing pain, it should be restricted to patients with early stage multiple myeloma. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD002073,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of endoscopic amnioreduction for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD002085,"Participant numbers in each comparison were small and we found no clear differences between orientation statement and phone prompt or other intervention methods. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop intervention strategies that might make it easier for people to attend initial psychiatric out-patient clinics."
CD002095,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of omeprazole for the treatment of non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality to determine the effectiveness of omeprazole for non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
CD002113,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of behavior therapy for incontinent elderly patients in nursing homes. The results suggest that it may be possible to provide this treatment to older patients with urinary incontinence who are homebound and unable to manage themselves.
CD002122,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of hormonal treatment of endometriosis in comparison to other treatments, such as intra-abdominal contraceptive pills or intra-abdominal contraceptive tablets. The use of any specific type of hormonal treatment for endometriosis is associated with a higher level of adverse events, which may explain why there is limited evidence to support the use of any specific type of hormonal treatment for endometriosis."
CD002139,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of adjuvant chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult regimens, these studies should be interpreted with caution. The aim of adjuvant chemotherapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is to prevent the progression of cancer by preventing the early adverse effects of radiotherapy, and to prevent the early adverse effects of chemotherapy that may result in the death of a patient."
CD002179,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of oxatomide as a treatment for asthma in children. In comparisons with placebo, oxatomide showed a significant advantage for asthma symptoms at the end of treatment.

CD002208,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in adults with evidence from two studies, however, it is clear that it is important to have a strategy for maintenance treatment. In addition to maintenance, other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of administration, ease of administration, costs and availability must be taken into consideration in deciding the type and dose of maintenance treatment. Future trials should pay more attention to the design of maintenance treatment, which should include more choice, and should include more safety information to allow better external validity."
CD002214,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of a nurse-led inpatient unit for intermediate care in the UK.

CD002962,We found a significant reduction in the need for oxytocin to augment labour in women with prelabor rupture of membranes. This may explain why there is limited evidence for a role for acupuncture in reducing the use of induction in post-term labour.
CD002964,"There are still only a small number of studies assessing the use of videotape instruction and feedback to improve mother-infant interactions in adolescence. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop and evaluate this use of videotape instruction and feedback to improve mother-infant interactions in adolescence."

Further randomised trials are needed to confirm the results"
CD003042,"We found no evidence regarding the effectiveness of either milking or stripping of chest tubes in myocardial revascularization. It is clear from the literature that both methods of chest tube clearance are effective in terms of drainage. However, there is a risk of cardiac tamponade, which may explain why there is a small number of patients who experience this after myocardial revascularization. Further studies are needed to determine if there are patients who may need to have their chest tubes manipulated following myocardial revascularization."

CD007345,"We found no clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for cholangitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis in comparison to placebo or other antibiotics, and no clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for cholangitis or other complications. The update identified six new patients, most of them patients with acute pancreatitis but with a history of other antibiotics, who were not included in the original version. However, the conclusions of the review did not change."
CD007350,"Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of patients with moderately severe Crohn's disease. lenalidomide may be useful as a adjunct to oral immunomodulatory drugs such as parenteral gold and parenteral gold. However, it should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD007394,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a highly common complication of marrow and blood transplantation in patients with hematological malignancies. The recent advent of an improved commercial serum aphlutination assay (ELISA) for the detection of circulating galactomannan (GM), a major constituent of Aspergillus cell walls, has contributed to the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. However, the high mortality rate and small sample sizes of the included studies made it difficult to assess the value of this method for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. In the absence of evidence from"
CD007404,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of calcitonin in the treatment of patients with central giant cell granuloma. Patients with this tumour are not candidates for routine administration of calcitonin. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this study and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of calcitonin.
CD007414,"Topotecan's efficacy and safety profile is not clear from a single trial. It is possible that the low incidence of adverse events and small sample size may make it difficult to recommend Cisplatin for primary cytoreductive surgery in patients with early stage ovarian cancer. In the absence of evidence from other trials, this review should be interpreted as a meta-analysis of two studies: one that showed no benefit from Cisplatin in complete remission and one that showed a significant benefit from the drug in the absence of any other clinical benefit."
CD007428,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of Knowles pins for fixation of midclavicular fractures of the clavicle in adults. This review provides evidence that, when used in patients with displaced midclavicular fractures of the clavicle, it shortens the time to union, increases union rates and may have benefits on functional outcomes."
CD007474,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific antipsychotic for treatment of schizophrenia. It is possible that the lack of D2 occupancy in the striatal region of the brain may be a significant adverse effect. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be conducted in patients with early episode schizophrenia where D2 occupancy is unclear.
CD007480,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin A supplementation for early infancy in developing countries. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.

CD007610,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of the podiatrist-related education and care programs offered in the general practice of diabetes care. These studies provide evidence that, in the setting of the dialysis unit, intensive podiatrist care may reduce the risk of systemic complications and may reduce the incidence of lower extremity clinical abnormalities. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the podiatrist-related education and care programs offered in the general practice of diabetes care."
CD007617,"We found some limited evidence of effects on caregiver satisfaction and quality of life in the intervention group, although these results were not statistically significant. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct family interventions that might make it more difficult for patients to leave hospice care."
CD007668,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of cognitive behaviour therapy for people with antisocial personality disorder (APD) who are seeking treatment for opioid dependence. In the absence of evidence from large scale randomized controlled trials, these results should be interpreted with caution.

CD007986,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of omega 3 fatty acids for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. One trial found significant effects for palmitoleic acid (as a supplementation) in the treatment of ADHD, whereas there was no evidence for omega 3 fatty acids in the treatment of ADHD in children with impulsivity or inattention. There is a need for more trials of high methodological quality in order to define the effectiveness of omega 3 fatty acids for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder."
CD008012,"There is evidence from one trial that sertraline reduces depressive symptoms and may reduce heart rate in patients with CABG when used as a primary treatment. However, there is no evidence that the drug reduces suicidal behaviour or suicidal behaviour in these patients and, although the risk of bleeding is increased with sertraline, there is no evidence that the drug reduces heart rate or other adverse events in these patients. The data suggest that in the short term, sertraline may reduce depressive symptoms and may reduce heart rate. However, long term data are lacking and, although the risk of bleeding is reduced with sertraline"
CD008107,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of FAMTX in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.

CD008120,We did not find evidence that a significant difference existed between quetiapine and placebo for the improvement of core anxiety symptoms in people with GAD who were already receiving pharmacotherapy for this disorder. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large randomised controlled trials of quetiapine for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.
CD008175,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of calcitriol for patients with chronic renal failure without a large scale randomized controlled trial. In the absence of evidence to support or refute the use of calcitriol for such patients, this review provides evidence to support the use of a small dose of calcitriol in such patients."
CD008186,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of aquatic therapy for people with chronic stroke. It may be useful for improving muscle strength in affected limbs, and for improving physical function in affected limbs. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the value of aquatic therapy for people with chronic stroke."
CD008203,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of rosuvastatin for prevention of venous thromboembolism. In a randomised controlled trial of high methodological quality, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the occurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism.

CD008388,"We found some limited evidence of effects on visual field function following VRT in patients with homonymous hemianopsia, but these results were not significant and were not reported in the literature. The results suggest that VRT may be a useful adjunct to cognitive therapy for people with hemianopia. However, the evidence of effectiveness is limited due to the small number of participants and the heterogeneity of the assessment. Further adequately powered trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of this therapy and the optimal dose and frequency of treatment."
CD008391,"We found significant advantages for the experimental group on the Metacomponential Interview measure in association with the explicit metacomponential training, but transfer to the real-life problem-solving measures was not evidenced in statistically significant findings. Small sample size, limited time of intervention, and some limitations with these tools may have been contributing factors to these results. The training program was demonstrated to have a significantly greater effect than the conventional training approach on metacomponential functioning and the component of problem representation."
