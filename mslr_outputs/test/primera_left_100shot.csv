2,CD000116,There is no evidence to suggest that intrapartum fetal monitoring with ST analysis reduces the risk of operative intervention due to fetal distress. There is a need to conduct large randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour to determine the effectiveness of intrapartum fetal monitoring with ST analysis.
3,CD000123,"The benefits of GAG in treating hyperlipidaemia are clear, and there is evidence that it reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and may reduce the pain-free walking distance in patients with peripheral arterial disease. However, there is no evidence that the GAG results are significant or not significant, and further research is needed."
4,CD000143,"NP-CPAP appears to be beneficial for extubation in that it reduces the need for reintubation and may reduce the risk of severe apnea. However, there is no information regarding the impact of N-CPAP on long-term outcomes and there is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not there are adverse effects from the use of N-CPAP on long-term outcomes.

7,CD000220,"There is evidence from one trial that metronidazole treatment of trichomoniasis in pregnant women is effective. This review does not cover the effects of metronidazole on other outcomes such as preterm delivery or mortality. The review did not cover the relative effectiveness of metronidazole compared with placebo or to other antibiotics, which is at present unclear. Further trials are needed to determine if metronidazole treatment is superior to placebo in preventing preterm delivery or to reducing the risk of"
8,CD000238,"There is limited evidence to suggest that supplemental oxygen reduces pulmonary function and may increase the risk of acute hypoxaemia in patients with severe COPD. However, there is no evidence that the use of supplemental oxygen reduces pulmonary function or may increase the risk of acute hypoxaemia.

13,CD000297," cyclosporine may have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with chronic Crohn's disease. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment is unknown. We recommend the use of other drugs for patients with Crohn's disease, and further randomised trials are conducted."
14,CD000305,"The administration of low-dose heparin to patients with hip fracture surgery is effective in terms of incidence of venous thromboembolic events and mortality. It is also effective in terms of ease of administration, lack of side-effects and overall satisfaction. This results from a well-designed and powered trial. The participants were instructed to report any adverse effects that might result from the use of low-dose heparin, and to report any adverse effects that might result from the use of high-dose heparin. The data collected in this review are not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of high-dose"
15,CD000345,"There is no evidence of effect of systemic corticosteroid treatment on the response to treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Patients with chronic hepatitis B did not report serious adverse effects from systemic corticosteroid treatment, when used short term."
16,CD000369,"Interferon-alpha may be effective for treating acute hepatitis C in a single dose. However, there was little evidence from the trials on the period after interferon-alpha treatment had finished and no information about the long-term effects of this therapy was given. Conversely, interferon-alpha may be harmful for patients with acute hepatitis C without an evidence-based benefit. However, there was little evidence from the trials on the period after interferon-alpha treatment had finished and no information about the long-term effects of this therapy was given."
17,CD000405,"Oral vancomycin treatment is effective in preventing NEC in preterm, very low birthweight infants. 
Further well designed randomised controlled trials should be conducted in settings where several individuals are involved, and in settings where NEC is known to be a risk."

19,CD000432,"The two groups were similar in gestational age, birth weight, delivery mode, sex distribution, and Apgar scores. The mean proportion of infants with more than six episodes of hypoxaemic episodes per 12 h was not statistically different in the caffeine group (79%) from the control group (86%). Our results suggest that prophylactic caffeine has little if any effect on the risk of developing hypoxaemic episodes and bradycardia in small preterm infants and the supposed 50% reduction which was considered clinically important at the start of the trial can be rejected with confidence."
20,CD000436,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of dietary salt on pulmonary function in people with asthma. The current review does not cover the relative effects of different dietary salt regimes, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not dietary salt has an effect on pulmonary function in people with asthma."
21,CD000460,"There is no evidence of effect of ASA on clinical outcomes in asthmatic patients and evidence of a small number of patients who respond to ASA but do not improve. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of ASA in preventing polyps in nasal polyps. The evidence of benefit of ASA in preventing polyps in nasal polyps is limited due to the small number of patients who respond and the small dose of ASA, which causes a small response."
22,CD000479,There is no evidence of effect of varicocele treatment on fertility. There is a limited evidence of the effectiveness of varicocele treatment on pregnancy.
23,CD000483,There is no high quality evidence that prophylactic hyperdynamic postoperative fluid therapy reduces the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia or that it reduces the risk of preoperative vasospasm. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from prophylactic fluid therapy regarding mortality.
24,CD000491,There is unclear evidence that amoxycillin is superior to nitrofurantoin in the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy. There is no evidence that the risk of endometrial and breast cancer is increased with amoxycillin. There is evidence that the risk of endometrial and breast cancer is increased with amoxycillin.
25,CD000525,A single trial has shown a significant benefit from the use of zuclopenthixol acetate in the treatment of acute psychosis. It must be decided whether this can be extrapolated to other patients. There is no definitive evidence from the use of zuclopenthixol acetate in the treatment of chronic psychosis.

26,CD000536,No evidence is available using oral anticoagulation therapy for peripheral arterial bypass surgery is effective.
27,CD000567,"The role of fluids in trauma resuscitation is controversial. We compared trials with different regimens of fluid resuscitation, found no clear differences between them, and found that the poorer the quality of the fluid, the more effective the resuscitation. However, the more stringent the regimens, the more likely it was that the participants would experience different outcomes. This could explain why there is limited evidence for the benefit of fluid resuscitation in the treatment of serious sepsis."
28,CD000934,There is unclear evidence that changes in the way antenatal care is offered are effective in terms of reduced visit schedules and associated adverse perinatal outcomes. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in developing countries to define the effectiveness of changes in antenatal care.
29,CD000948,"We found no clear differences in the rate of atelectasis, length of intubation, or clinical problems during the use of either orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation in neonates. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of different methods of orotracheal intubation compared to other routes in preventing atelectasis and improving length of intubation in neonates."
30,CD000972," dexamethasone appears to be ineffective for treating cerebral malaria. There is no evidence of effect of high-dose dexamethasone on mortality and complications in patients with cerebral malaria. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of high-dose dexamethasone compared to placebo or other dexamethasone treatments in treating cerebral malaria."
31,CD000978,"The benefits of oral mucositis prevention have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of oral mucositis prevention, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
32,CD000980, vitamin C supplementation reduces the incidence of postrace symptoms of upper-respiratory-tract infection in ultramarathon runners. This study determined whether daily supplementation with 600 mg vitamin C would reduce the incidence of symptoms of upper-respiratory-tract (URT) infections after participation in a competitive ultramarathon race (> 42 km). Ultramarathon runners with age-matched controls were randomly divided into placebo and experimental (vitamin C-supplemented) groups. Symptoms of URT infections were monitored for 14 d after the race. There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence or duration
33,CD000996,Inhaled fluticasone therapy appears to be beneficial for patients with bronchiectasis. There is no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of bronchiectasis. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
34,CD001005,There is evidence from one trial that educating patients with asthma about the disease and its complications reduces their use of hospital services and may have benefits on health. There is no evidence that the information given to patients in this study is effective.
35,CD001018,"Treatment with either estrogen or progestin in post-menopausal women is effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and increasing the risk of weight gain. However, the effects on long-term health status and quality of life are not clear. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HRT groups despite the inability to tailor HRT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific ""within study"" comparisons."
36,CD001024,"Tamoxifen appears to be beneficial for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there is no evidence of a benefit from this treatment in the short term and further research is needed."
37,CD001036,"The quality of the cervical smear, a decisive factor in the efficacy of population screening, can depend on the sampling method utilized. An analysis of five sample takers in a screening program, each of whom had made approximately 5,000 smears, and of the five sampling methods each had used: spatula alone (method A), Cytobrush plus spatula (method B), Cytopick (method C), cotton swab plus spatula (method D) and Cervex brush (method E). The results demonstrate that the ability of a single sample to determine the quality of a smear is significantly more important than the"
38,CD001046,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of methylprednisolone for patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury. When used within 8 hours of injury, methylprednisolone may be associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower incidence of complications than corticosteroids or bupivacaine. However, the data on these two drugs is not adequate to make specific recommendations. The data on corticosteroids and bupivacaine is adequate to make recommendations regarding the use of these drugs in the treatment of acute cervical spinal cord injury."
39,CD001055,There is evidence that different smoking cessation interventions can be used in different settings and settings. This will allow researchers to make comparisons across studies.
40,CD001059,"Calcium supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a small reduction in the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. However, there is no evidence of a effect on the rate of preterm delivery or preclampsia. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of calcium supplementation in pregnancy to determine if there is a benefit for women from this intervention."
41,CD001062,"The benefits of maternal antenatal decompression treatment are unclear due to the small number of participants and the lack of detailed outcome information. However, it is clear from the literature that decompression may be a useful adjunct to medication for women with pre-eclampsia."
42,CD001066,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of reflexology for women with pedal edema. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.

There is a requirement for a large scale trial of high methodological quality to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is a need for a large scale trial of high methodological quality to confirm the preliminary results from this review.
49,CD001266,"The use of bronchodilators for children with bronchiolitis is not new. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of these agents for children. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of bronchodilators for children with bronchiolitis compared to other means of treatment such as parenteral gold or parenteral gold."
50,CD001275,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of laser treatment for pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury. The intervention may be useful in preventing the adverse effects of laser treatment on wound healing.
51,CD001293,"The benefits of school-based smoking prevention programs have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of school-based smoking prevention programs, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
52,CD001297,GnRH agonists can cause significant bone loss in women with endometriosis. One trial found significant side effects following GnRH agonists when compared to no treatment or a placebo. Another trial found significant side effects following GnRH agonists when compared to a placebo or a placebo. There is no clear evidence that the use of GnRH agonists for endometriosis is effective.
53,CD001331,There is no high quality evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone for patients with RR-MS. There is a limited evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone for patients with RR-MS. There is a need for more high quality trials to support the use of methylprednisolone for patients with RR-MS.
54,CD001332,"Tizanidine appears to be a useful antispastic drug for patients with spasticity. It is unclear whether the beneficial effects of tizanidine will be equally effective as the anti-spastic drug baclofen. The beneficial effects of tizanidine are unclear due to the high side-effects that were seen with the other drugs, which included sedation, nausea and vomiting. There was no clear evidence from the trials on the effectiveness of dantrolene sodium, which may be beneficial although there was no evidence from the trials on the other drugs. There was no clear evidence from the trials on the"

[Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"
56,CD001342,"Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that anticoagulation is effective in preventing ischemic stroke or death in patients with transient ischemic attacks or those with minor stroke of presumed arterial origin. The results do not apply to absence or myocardial infarction. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies."
57,CD001351,"The evidence from this review of RCTs of acupuncture and TENS in chronic low back pain is not limited to countries where these treatments are available. There is evidence from one trial that TENS leads to a smaller pain score than acupuncture, but there is no evidence that this is the case for all patients. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of different modes of TENS in chronic low back pain, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review that acupuncture is superior to TENS in alleviating low back pain."
58,CD001367,"There is no convincing evidence to support the continued administration of anticoagulation in patients with first episode venous thromboembolism. The risk of recurrence is higher after treatment of an episode of venous thromboembolism associated with a transient risk factor, such as recent surgery, than after an episode associated with a permanent, or no, risk factor. Retrospective analyses suggest that 1 month of anticoagulation is adequate for patients whose venous thromboembolic event was provoked by a transient risk factor. In this double-blind study, patients who had completed 1 month of anticoag"
59,CD001418,No evidence is available using any single agent is effective for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
60,CD001419,"Aduvant chemotherapy may be effective in reducing local recurrence and improving survival in patients with high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of this therapy in primary cancer and no evidence is available in secondary cancer. There is a risk of adverse effects with Adriamycin, which may explain why there is limited evidence for this in primary cancer and no evidence for secondary cancer. Aduvant chemotherapy should be offered to those with primary cancer and in the wealthiest countries."
61,CD001431,There is evidence that decision aids provide important information to help people make informed decisions about the care of their health.
62,CD001439,No evidence is available using antibiotics prophylaxis in patients undergoing appendicectomy is effective.

64,CD001490,"Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) appears to be beneficial for patients with moderate to severe asthma who are not responding to conventional therapy. However, it does not appear to be effective for patients with acute asthma who are not responding to steroids. There is no evidence of effect of magnesium on hospital admission and mortality."
65,CD001539,"The use of audiotapes for cancer consultations is growing. There is evidence from one trial that the use of a AUDIOTAPE for a cancer consultation improves patient satisfaction, and may have implications for clinical trials. There is no evidence that the use of a AUDIOTAPE for a cancer consultation is effective."
66,CD001543,There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies a hernia repair. The risk of recurrence is high for both techniques. Studies identifying the most effective repair method are needed.
67,CD001691,"There is no evidence to suggest that phenobarbital reduces the incidence of periventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants and it is possible that it may increase the risk of such a thing. However, there is no evidence to support the use of phenobarbital for prevention of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in very low birth weight infants. There is a risk of severe and early IVH in infants with low and extremely low birth weight. These infants should be treated with surfactant-free treatment."
68,CD001694,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of the use of furosemide for preterm infants with chronic lung disease. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
69,CD001705,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a sliding-screw-plate for displaced femoral neck fracture treatment. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods, the review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest technique available. Further randomised trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of sliding-screw-plate treatment compared to no treatment or closed reduction."
70,CD001715,"This systematic review indicates that sertindole is an efficacious antipsychotic in patients with schizophrenia. It is associated with fewer side-effects than haloperidol but with a similar incidence of adverse events. In patients with early episode schizophrenia, sertindole appears to be similar to haloperidol in terms of dose and efficacy but with a higher instance of adverse events"
71,CD001782,"Topical tretinoin improves photoaged skin. Tretinoin is effective in reducing the signs of photoaging, which is important in preventing wrinkles. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of topical tretinoin for the treatment of photoaging. In addition, tretinoin may be associated with a number of adverse effects, which may explain why it is not recommended for most people with photoaging.
[Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"
72,CD001815,"Oral erythromycin appears to be beneficial for preterm infants with feeding intolerance. In comparisons with placebo, time taken to establish full enteral feeding was significantly shorter in the erythromycin group (as assessed by the time taken to full feeding) than in the control group (as assessed by the time taken to full enteral feeding). However, there was no evidence from the comparisons tested within the studies. Further trials are needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration of erythromycin, and to examine whether it has effects on long term outcomes."

There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of local anesthetic infiltration of the peritonsillar region after tonsillectomy.
75,CD001878,There is evidence that exercise reduces headache pain. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
76,CD001896,Presacral neurectomy appears to be beneficial for women with primary dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis. It reduces the frequency and severity of menstrual pain and may reduce the risk of recurrence. Women with endometriosis who are treated with conservative surgery are more likely to be satisfied with their treatment and to report lower abdominal pain.
77,CD001900," remacemide hydrochloride appears to be beneficial for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, there is insufficient information about other benefits of REM to determine the overall effectiveness of the trial. The data are too sparse to assess the effects of REM on other drugs in patients with refractory epilepsy."

This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures."
79,CD001943,"Loxapine appears to be similar to trifluoperazine in terms of efficacy and safety. In patients with psychogenic schizophrenia, LOX appears to be similar to perphenazine in terms of efficacy and safety. In patients with chronic schizophrenia, LOX appears to be similar to chlorpromazine in terms of efficacy and safety."
80,CD001946,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effects of propranolol in the treatment of akathisia.
81,CD001983,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of calcitonin for prevention of osteoporosis. In patients with RA treated with low dose glucocorticoids, calcitonin may be effective in preventing bone loss. However, there is a high risk of side effects, which may explain why there is limited evidence for a benefit of calcitonin in preventing osteoporosis. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."

85,CD002009,"Once daily tobramycin treatment is effective for patients with cystic fibrosis without an increase in the risk of hearing loss. It is more effective than three daily doses of tobramycin (without ceftazidime) in reducing the bacterial load in the airways and improving clinical and lung function. However, the single daily dose is more associated with higher toxicity than the three daily regimen. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing regimens."

90,CD002068,"Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific dose of clodronate for patients with bone metastases. It is clear from the literature that the best dose of clodronate for patients with bone metastases is 600 mg daily. This dose reduces the risk of pathologic fractures and may reduce the incidence of pain. Patients with bone metastases cannot be offered more than a single dose of clodronate."
91,CD002073,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific treatment for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The most effective treatment for the condition is laser therapy. Further randomised controlled trials are needed, preferably multi-centred trials."
92,CD002085,There are still only a small number of studies assessing the use of intervention techniques to reduce the no-show rates at community mental health centers. Most of the studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
93,CD002095," proton-pump inhibitors have some theoretical advantages over other proton-pump inhibitors in alleviating symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. However, most of the studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed."
94,CD002113,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of FIT in nursing homes. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
95,CD002122,"There is unclear evidence that dienogest is effective for the treatment of recurrent pain associated with endometriosis. There is a risk of endometriosis recurrence when used in this manner. In addition, dienogest may increase the risk of breast cancer. Although the mechanism of action of the progestin inhibits the growth of endometriosis, it may increase the risk of breast cancer. With limited data on other factors, such as side effects and costs, these results should be interpreted with caution.

303,CD005539,There is no high quality evidence that a nutrition screening tool has an effect on the quality of care of elderly patients in hospital. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
304,CD005542,"There is no evidence to suggest that the micropumps used in treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are superior to insulin therapy. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of micropumps compared to insulin therapy in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy."

311,CD005944,"There is evidence that vitamin A supplementation, especially vitamin A palmitate, is beneficial for mothers and infants. However, there is insufficient information about the effect of vitamin A supplementation on mortality and morbidity in infants and it is unclear whether this can be extrapolated to mothers and infants. There is a risk of endometrial and breast cancer after vitamin A supplementation, but the evidence is not robust."
312,CD005950,"There is evidence from one trial that mental practice (MP) increases the use of affected arm function in stroke patients. This results from a small study in which only a small number of patients were included. The evidence is not significant when compared to no treatment or control groups. However, it does suggest that in the initial phase of stroke recovery, mental practice may be a useful adjunct to therapy. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not the results of this review apply to other patients."
313,CD005952,"There is no high quality evidence that occupational therapy provides important improvements in the functional ability of people with stroke to perform activities of daily living. This is based on small studies in which no intervention was given, no outcome measures were included or analysis was not done."
314,CD005959,"There is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of intramedullary nails for fixation of humeral shaft fractures of the humerus. They may be useful in preventing the shortening of the arm or shoulder, and in preventing the development of infection. However, there is a risk of endangering the patient's health with IMN, and there is a risk of long term adverse consequences with the plate. Compared to no nail treatment or compression plate fixation, there was a statistically significant difference in the rate of union and in the incidence of complications. However, these results were not statistically significant for the nails."
315,CD006002,"We found no clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of interferon-alpha treatment for chronic hepatitis D. The beneficial effects of interferon-alpha for chronic hepatitis D were limited due to the high dose of treatment, the short follow-up and the small number of participants in the study. Further adequately powered trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of interferon-alpha in preventing the progression of chronic hepatitis D."

317,CD006033,There is unclear evidence that contraceptive methods differ according to the type of contraceptive used or the dose of the progestogen in the contraceptive packet. This could be because of the different methodologies employed in the trials or because of the differing methodologies employed in the trials. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies contraceptive methods in different women.
318,CD006069,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of synthetic surfactant for the prevention of RDS. The available evidence is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of non-protein-containing synthetic surfactants. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of non-protein-containing synthetic surfactants compared to other non-protein-containing surfactants, including those containing lucinactant proteins, which is the most effective of the non-protein-containing surfactants. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required to assess the effectiveness"
319,CD006097,"Natalizumab appears to be beneficial for patients with moderately active Crohn's disease. In comparisons with placebo, natalizumab results in a smaller mean reduction in CDAI (as assessed by the CDAI activity Index) than placebo but not compared to natalizumab alone. Patients with Crohn's disease who had responded to natalizumab in one trial were more likely to experience a serious adverse event, such as pyloric stenosis. The risk of death from natalizumab appears to be similar to placebo."

321,CD006107,"There is no evidence that the use of ultrasound guidance during embryo transfer improves the pregnancy rate of women undergoing in vitro fertilisation. There is a risk that the increase in the number of transfers will increase, and as a result, women may be more likely to have complications. This could explain why there is limited evidence for an effect of ultrasound on pregnancy in assisted conception."

327,CD006193,"Cemented fixation of the tibial component of a total knee arthroplasty is more effective than uncemented fixation. The increased constraint provided by the FS1000 component did not appear to have any adverse effect on the fixation of the femoral component. When using uncemented components, however, there is evidence that augmenting a porous surface with hydroxyapatite may mean less motion between implant and bone after the initial postoperative year. This review provides evidence to show that the use of cement is more effective than the use of no cement in improving the quality of total knee replacement."

342,CD006403,"Routine administration of AVA in a reduced dose schedule and intramuscular administration of AVA is effective and safe. The TNA response after two injections of the 75 microg dose of rPA102 is similar to the response after two injections of AVA. The third rPA102 vaccination substantially increased the antibody response. 
Results from one trial showed that the 4-IM route of AVA administration is safe and effective when compared to the 4-SQ route. However, the rate of local and systemic reactogenicity was higher in the 4-IM group compared to the 4-SQ.

346,CD006469,There is unclear evidence that combination chemotherapy is superior to single-agent chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The response rate is similar to cisplatin alone and to ifosfamide-IP. There is no evidence that the incidence of complete and partial remission is superior to that of chemotherapy alone.
347,CD006484,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the response to influenza vaccination in children with cancer. The results suggest that influenza vaccination is safe and effective in children with cancer. However, there is a high risk of acquired natural infection in the situation described. Consequently, children with cancer should be offered a full-fledged vaccination, preferably two doses, that includes the required antigens."
348,CD006505,There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of the administration of influenza vaccination in children with leukemia. The results suggest that the administration of influenza vaccination is not effective in children with leukemia when started at the beginning of therapy or after chemotherapy.
349,CD006533,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about duloxetine's lack of efficacy in acute treatment of major depressive disorder did not change. Given availability of more effective treatments including serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, duloxetine does not have a significant place in therapy based on available evidence."
350,CD006616,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about N-acetylcysteine's lack of efficacy in preventing acute renal failure in CABG patients was not changed.

On the other hand, 74.2 per cent of the tetanus patients who received the conventional antitetanus therapy without AA (control group) were succumbed to the infection. In the other age group of 13-30 years, there were 27 and 38 patients in the treatment and control groups respectively. The mortality in the AA and control groups were 37 percent and 67.8 percent respectively. These results suggest that AA might play an important role in reducing the mortality of tetanus."

It is more effective than prednisolone enemas in reducing endoscopic index reductions and in reducing the rate of remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis. However, there is no evidence of effect of IFN-alpha-2A compared to placebo, and side effects are more common in the alpha group. Further high quality, fully powered trials are required to confirm the trends of effectiveness identifed in this review."
365,CD006829,"The combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol has a small clinically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with COPD. This review does not cover the relative efficacy of the two drugs alone, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not the improved lung function and health status attributable to the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol is improved compared to placebo."
366,CD006853,The RAPIT program appears to be more effective than physical therapy in improving functional ability of patients with RA. No significant changes were seen in the rate of improvement in the MACTAR questionnaire or in the HAQ score. This review has not examined economic data.

There is a risk ofindicated death in the laparoscopic group (10% versus 33%) but no evidence of harm in the open group. The risk ofindicated death in the laparoscopic group is not clear.
374,CD006963,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of IVRO compared to SSRO. In the case of prognathic mandible, the risk of acute trauma is high. Consequently, IVRO may be recommended in the treatment of mandibular prognathic pain. The risk of acute trauma is less in the case of IVRO compared to SSRO. Consequently, this treatment should be offered to those patients with a diagnosis of prognathic mandible."

376,CD007024,"Disulfiram appears to be beneficial for people with co-occurring cocaine and alcohol dependence. In comparisons with placebo, the effects of disulfiram were significant for people who used cocaine in association with alcohol. The drug was associated with a lower rate of use of cocaine and alcohol than placebo, and a lower rate of use of alcohol than no drug. However, there was no evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this study and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of disulfiram."

Published literature on the subject lacks the methodological rigour or robust reporting needed to make confident assessments of the use of TENS in labour. Large multi-centre RCTs of TENS in labour are still needed."
383,CD007224,There is evidence that off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery reduces the risk of systemic inflammation and is associated with less mortality and morbidity than on-pump surgery. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is new safety data which indicates that the risk of systemic inflammation and myocardial injury is reduced with off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery.
