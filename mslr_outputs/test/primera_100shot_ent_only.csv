CD000074,"Of the 15 infants randomly assigned to receive doxapram, four responded for the duration of the study; of the nine who did not respond to doxapram, one responded to a combination of theophylline and doxapram, and one remained resistant to treatment. This study demonstrates that although therapy with theophylline or doxapram is associated with a significant short-term reduction in the incidence of apnea coordinate compared with that in Jeffersonville, Tennessee -treated infants, the long-term response to treatment is frequently incomplete and is not sustained more than 1 week."
CD000116,"There was a trend towards fewer operative interventions for presumed fetal distress in the time-interval analysis plus cardiotocography group (63 [13%] vs 78 [16%]), but this was not significant (relative risk 0.70; 95% CI 0.38-1.28; number needed to treat 252).

CD002214,"There was no significant difference in the measure of initial length of stay (4.5 days longer (-3.6 to 12.5)). No differences were observed in mean total cost of care Fiscal year 2021- 2022 should be the first year of full transparency in the provision of post-acute care. In order to assess the potential for a inpatient nurse-led unit (NLIU) to substitute for a period of care in the acute hospital environment and to promote recovery before discharge, a controlled trial was conducted. The setting was an inner London hospital trust, part of the UK's national health service."
CD002217,We found no significant difference in efficacy selector between the study drugs (adjusted hazard ratio for time to first seizure from randomisation) and their use in controlling generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.

The aim of our open pilot study was to verify whether any difference in perceived illness and prolific response to asthma existed in the patients enrolled for this review. One hundred six asthmatic subjects were medically prestabilized, then assigned to eight sessions of progressive relaxation, music, or a waiting-list. The results demonstrate that the CBT AE program is capable of producing substantial and durable abolition of the last four major adverse events of asthma, and that it may be used with caution in patients"
CD002987,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with severe, steroid-requiring asthma, low-dose methylprednisolone is an effective therapy. In comparisons with placebo, reductions in forced expiratory volume in 1 second were not significantly increased in any groups. However, there was a significant 10% reduction in the rate of resolution of severe asthma in patients with severe, steroid-requiring asthma when compared with placebo. This conclusion is limited by the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment, and the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes"

However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of a non-opioid drug for treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of entacapone, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD007191,"There is no evidence of effect of prophylaxis of Mycobacterium avium complex on outcomes in HIV-infected patients with AIDS. We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of treatment with quinolone twice daily for six months in patients with advanced HIV-infected patients who had a median of at least six months of tolerated treatment with quinolone.

The risk of endometrial and breast cancer progression was increased for patients with early stage ovarian cancer who were given chemotherapy."
CD007428,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with displaced mid-shaft fractures of the clavicle, a three-dimensional fixation fixation method is effective. This fixation method is more effective than a single-dimensional fixation method because it reduces the risk of postoperative bleeding, reduces the time to union and improves the rate of revision of the clavicle. The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with displaced mid-shaft fractures of the clavicle, a three-dimensional fixation method is effective."
CD007474,We found a significant difference in D2 occupancy between risperidone and olanzapine in patients with early episode schizophrenia. This was based on a single-blind trial. No comparisons were made with other antipsychotic drugs.
