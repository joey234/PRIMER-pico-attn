0,CD000024,No studies have compared heparin with other anticoagulation classes such as heparin and myoclonus. There is only limited evidence to suggest use of low-dose heparin is effective or not effective in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in people with acute ischemic stroke. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing heparin with other anticoagulation classes such as heparin and myoclonus.
1,CD000074,Theophylline and doxapram are effective in reducing apnea in infants with prematurity but are more equivocal in reducing the incidence of apnea in infants with no intervention. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing theophylline with other classes of drug in the treatment of apnea of prematurity.
2,CD000116,"There is little evidence to suggest that intrapartum fetal monitoring reduces the rate of neonatal acidemia or metabolic acidosis when compared with no intervention or perinatal monitoring. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of intrapartum fetal monitoring compared with no intervention or perinatal monitoring."
3,CD000123,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of oral cholesterol lowering on walking distances in people with intermittent claudication. The results suggest that progressive resisted treatment may improve muscle strength in affected muscles.

263,CD004943,"We have compared the effect of oral ranitidine and ranitidine on gastric contents in 80 consecutive women undergoing emergency Caesarean section. Since antisecretory agents do not clear stomach contents already present at the start of treatment, two groups of patients have been randomly assigned to receive either ranitidine 50 mg or omeprazole 40 mg intravenously. In addition, all patients received 30 mL of 0.3 M sodium citrate on entry into the operating room. Aspiration of gastric contents was undertaken immediately after endotracheal intubation (PI) and before tracheal extubation."
264,CD004950,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in pain was achieved when infants were treated with oral glucose or sucrose. The results suggest that breastfeeding may reduce pain intermittants when they are undergoing blood sampling for newborn screening. This could be because the glucose in the solution is more soluble than the other solutions.

382,CD007214,"There is little evidence to suggest that TENS is effective in reducing pain during childbirth. The results suggest that the benefits of TENS may be more equivocal than expected. This could be because the pain thresholds for the two outcomes are different. Before and after TENS, women are asked to assess pain with visual analog scale. There is no apparent reduction in the number of analgesics administered to them."
383,CD007224,CPB is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and is a major cause of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is more effective than CABG in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain people tend to prefer CABG to off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of grafting. Short-term data indicate that CABG leads to fewer respiratory disturbances than long-term data are required for all outcomes. Long-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in

439,CD008643,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the usefulness of lumbar spine films in primary care. The current use of lumbar spine films is limited due to the small sample sizes and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of use of lumbar spine films in primary care."
440,CD008765,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of secondary cytoreductive surgery on survival in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. The benefits are more pronounced in people with no residual disease. However, a small number of people with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer have died from the results."
441,CD008838,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between venom immunotherapy and placebo for the outcomes examined in this review. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.

443,CD008870,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral 5-aminosalicylic acid in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. The results suggest that 5-ASA is effective in reducing symptoms of bowel inflammation.
444,CD008871,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of radical retropubic prostatectomy on functional outcomes in patients with low-risk prostatic cancer. The results suggest that RRP and brachytherapy are effective in reducing urinary disturbances and improving erective function in these patients.
445,CD008890,"We found no clear evidence to support routine use of bleomycin in the treatment of craniopharyngiomas. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of the drug in the treatment of polycystic craniopharyngiomas, where it may improve the survival of patients."
446,CD009072,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between PCT and reference PLT for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
447,CD009109,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of endodontically treated premolars on the survival of those restored with direct composite restoration or with full-coverage metal-ceramic crowns. The results suggest that the initial success rates of endodontically treated premolars restored with fiber posts and direct composite restoration are more equivocal than the results from the two experimental groups.
448,CD009110,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of topical dressings with ionic silver in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of topical dressings with ionic silver in the treatment of out-patients with Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus and non- ischaemic Wagner Grade 1 or 2 DFUs."
449,CD009118,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between PEG and lactulose for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
450,CD009153,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the studies and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of current treatment policies in preventing HIV-1 infection."
451,CD009154,"The benefits of oral progesterone have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of oral progesterone, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
452,CD009190,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of telephonic psycho-social support on adherence to post-exposure prophylaxis after rape. The results suggest that progressive resisted intervention may improve adherence to PEP.
453,CD009192,We found no clear evidence to support routine oral HIV testing with the option of telephone notification of HIV results in high-risk youth. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing face-to-face with telephone notification of HIV results.
454,CD009202,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between propofol and barbiturates for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.

457,CD009308,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from family-directed programs.
458,CD009379,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of amniotic membrane transplantation on visual outcomes in patients with acute ocular burns. The results suggest that amniotic membrane transplantation may improve the healing of epithelial defect in patients with moderate grade burns.
459,CD009404,We found no clear evidence to support the use of educational program in reducing the incidence of wrong-site tooth extraction.
460,CD009415,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of zinc on body composition in people with sickle cell disease. The results suggest that zinc could be effective in preventing crisis in people with SCD. Administration of zinc could, therefore, be considered as an effective adjuvant therapy in homozygous beta-thalassemia."
461,CD009461,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between groups of women for the outcomes examined in this review. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No evidence was found comparing groups of women for the outcomes examined in this review.
462,CD009593,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two tests for the detection of tuberculosis and its drug resistance. The results suggest that the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is effective in detecting tuberculosis and its drug resistance before treatment is initiated. However, the true benefits of the test are unclear. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of the test, because data reported in the studies are scarce."
463,CD009755,We found no significant effect on the risk of preterm birth or small- for-gestational age birth from the small numbers of studies to date. Many relevant studies are currently underway or awaiting publication.
464,CD009792,"We found no clear evidence to support induction of labor in women with prior cesareans with misoprostol. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of misoprostol in inducing labor in such women."

The results suggest that milnacipran may be effective in reducing pain in people with FM with or without major depressive disorder.
468,CD010610,"We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in migraine frequency was achieved with the help of exercise. However, this could be because the two trials were underpowered to detect uncommon adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. Additional evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of topiramate compared to placebo or other anticonvulsants in preventing migraine properly."
469,CD010611,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in migraine attacks was achieved when treated with DVPX compared with placebo. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
