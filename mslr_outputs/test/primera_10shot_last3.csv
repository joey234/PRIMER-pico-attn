CD000074,Theophylline is effective in reducing symptoms of sleepiness in infants with significant apnoea. It is more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of sleepiness in these infants but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain infants tend to prefer theophylline to doxapram. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of controlling apnoea. Short-term data indicate that theophylline leads to lower incidence of apnoea than doxapram. Long-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in short-term clinical trials
