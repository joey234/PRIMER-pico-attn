CD000024,"Argatroban appears to be beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke. In comparisons with placebo, there was no significant difference in mortality or DVT. Time interval and LDH were significant risk factors for DVT. Argatroban appears to be beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke."
CD000074,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of theophylline treatment for apnea in infants with prematurity.
CD000116,There is evidence from one trial that automatic ST analysis reduces the rate of operative intervention due to fetal distress. This results from a reduction in rates of metabolic acidosis and low Apgar scores. There is no evidence that the use of automatic ST analysis for intrapartum monitoring of fetus is effective.
CD000123,"The Sulodexide treatment results in a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in claudication, and it reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events among patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease. In addition to reducing the risk of claudication, Sulodexide may reduce the frequency of claudication, and thus may have benefits on health-related quality of life. However, many of the trials were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of"
CD000143,"N-CPAP may be beneficial for infants with respiratory distress. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of N-CPAP in this manner. With limited data on other methods of extubation, this should be interpreted with caution."
CD000146,There is increasing evidence that different nicotine replacement therapy methods can be used in different ways. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of nicotine patch to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased adverse outcomes. These drugs can no longer be recommended in the treatment of smoking cessation. Readers of the first review should re-read the document in full.
CD000168,"Preoperative skin traction should be resisted in patients with hip fractures because of its high cost and lack of evidence from the current trial data. Adverse events appear to be similar to traction, although there may be a risk of side effects when used in intra-abdominal patients. Adverse events appear to be similar to traction, although there may be a risk of side effects when used in intra-abdominal patients."
CD000220,"We found a limited evidence for the efficacy of systemic trichomoniasis treatment with a single dose of metronidazole in preventing preterm delivery. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of systemic trichomoniasis in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated focusing on administration methods."
CD000238,"There is limited evidence to suggest that supplemental oxygen, when used in the short term, improves exercise performance in patients with severe COPD. There is no apparent improvement in quality of life measures in patients with severe COPD when compared with domiciliary air."
CD000246,"Antibiotic treatment for threatened preterm labour is effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. However, it may increase the risk of respiratory distress, major cerebral abnormality, and preterm birth. This could be because of the high dose of antibiotics, which is used in most studies, and the small number of participants. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in threatened preterm labour and in the general population."
CD000254,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of vitamin E supplementation for people with age-related macular degeneration. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
CD000255,There is increasing evidence that spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is a clinical sign of stroke. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the benefit of anticoagulation with caution.
CD000259,There is evidence that practice feedback can improve the quality of primary healthcare care. There is no evidence that this can be extrapolated to other health care settings. There is evidence that practice feedback can improve the quality of primary health care. There is evidence that this can be extrapolated to other health care settings.
CD000297,"Low-dose cyclosporine may have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the activity of patients with Crohn's disease. However, this is based on a small number of patients and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of cyclosporine in treating active Crohn's disease and the need for surgery."
CD000305,Heparin prophylaxis should be offered to those undergoing surgery for hip fracture.
CD000345,"Interferon appears to be a effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B. In patients with chronic hepatitis B, interferon is effective in reducing inflammatory activities and improving liver function. However, there is no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The most effective treatment is interferon, but further trials are needed."
CD000369,"Interferon may reduce the frequency of recurrence and the risk of chronic hepatitis in patients with acute hepatitis C. However, few of the patients studied in this review were in the control group, and therefore the evidence base is limited."
CD000405,There is evidence from one trial that vancomycin prophylaxis is effective in preventing necrotising enterocolitis. This results from a randomised controlled trial of high methodological rigour and robust reporting. It is not clear that a similar result can be found from a controlled trial of high methodological rigour and robust reporting.
CD000409,We found some limited evidence that educational interventions can lead to changes in practice. There is still a requirement for large scale RCTs of educational interventions to confirm the preliminary results from this review.
CD000432,"There is no evidence to suggest that caffeine reduces the risk of hypoxaemia and bradycardia in preterm infants and it is possible that it may increase these. These data do not support the continued use of caffeine in the situation described. However, it should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD000436,"Higher sodium intake (≥ 5 to 6 g per day) from dietary sources does not alter pulmonary function in people with asthma. However, high sodium intake (≥ 14 to 21 g per day) from dietary sources may increase the bronchial reactivity and asthma-related adverse events. These results apply to people with mild asthma and to people with severe asthma. The"
CD000460,"Tartrazine and benzoate may have an beneficial effect on patients with asthma. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these substances in the treatment of asthma."
CD000479,There is unclear evidence that varicocele therapy improves sperm parameters and fertility in men with varicocele. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing varicocele therapy with other treatments such as contraception or spermatogenesis. The only possible differences between treatments are those between arms or between patients.
CD000483,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of prophylactic postoperative fluid therapy in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD000491,There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of antibiotic for the treatment of bacteriuria in pregnancy. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD000525,Zuclopenthixol appears to be beneficial for the symptoms of acute schizophrenia. In acute schizophrenia the risk of hypokinesia is high. Haloperidol and zuclopenthixol may be alternative treatments for this condition.
CD000536,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of anticoagulation for patients undergoing peripheral arterial bypass surgery. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
CD000567,There is increasing evidence that different fluid resuscitation regimens are effective in reducing mortality and improving pulmonary insufficiency in patients with severe sepsis. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of hydroxyethyl starch to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased adverse outcomes in fluid resuscitation.
CD000934,Anticipated reductions in the number of prenatal care visits for women at low risk are not associated with significant increases in adverse perinatal outcomes. There is no evidence of effect of reduced visit schedules on maternal and newborn outcomes and there is limited evidence of effect of reduced visit schedules on psychosocial outcomes.
CD000948,"We found no clear evidence to support or refute the use of orotracheal and NT intubation in patients requiring ventilatory assistance. However, it is quite possible that the lack of evidence in this field may have adverse effects in patients undergoing intubation."
CD000972,"There is no evidence to suggest that dexamethasone is effective for treating cerebral malaria. There is a risk of complications, which may explain why there is limited evidence for the use of dexamethasone in this situation."
CD000978,There is increasing evidence that oral mucositis is both safe and effective for preventing the harms of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of divergentrine to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased adverse outcomes. These drugs can no longer be recommended in the treatment of oral mucositis. Readers of the first review should re-read the document in full.
CD000980,"The previous version of this review showed that vitamin C had a small clinically and statistically significant effect on the frequency of respiratory infections in people who were not under heavy physical stress. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of people, vitamin C does not have a significant effect on frequency of respiratory infections and may be beneficial in preventing common cold."
CD000996,"Although corticosteroid therapy is effective in reducing symptoms of bronchiectasis, it is not effective in reducing the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD001005,There is evidence from one trial that education offered to adult patients with asthma is effective in terms of knowledge and use of drugs. This results from a small study that was unable to detect any significant effects on patient satisfaction and health status. There is evidence that education offered to adult patients with asthma is effective in terms of knowledge and use of drugs.
CD001018,HRT may have some small benefits for women regarding health-related outcomes. We recommend further well-designed trials on the effectiveness of HRT for women with predisposing risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
CD001024,There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of tamoxifen for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD001036,"The Cytobrush collects a larger concentration of endocervical cells than the Ayre spatula. The use of a particular collection technique is associated with a number of adverse effects, most of them relating to the quality of the smears. It is clear from the literature that the quality of cervical smears is a major factor in the diagnosis of cervical dysplasia."
CD001046,"methylprednisolone when given within 8 hours of injury is a effective primary treatment for acute spinal cord injury. However, a follow-up trial of high methodological quality is required to determine the effectiveness of this treatment compared to other primary treatments such as corticosteroids or naloxone. The risk of pulmonary complications is high. MPSS may be offered to patients with acute spinal cord injury diagnosed within 8 hours of injury. In"
CD001055,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials including 4213 women, moderate quality evidence suggests that motivational interviewing is an effective means of reducing smoking cessation in women who are undergoing maternity care. It should be recognised that this review is not a clinical trial. It is a collection of reported studies."
CD001059,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of calcium supplementation for the prevention of preclampsia and hypertension in women during pregnancy. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of high methodological quality in order to define any benefit from calcium supplementation on the risk of preterm delivery and hypertension.
CD001062,"The current evidence base on the topic of abdominal decompression is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of abdominal decompression in preventing pre-eclampsia."
CD001066,"HR may have some small benefits for women with severe pedal edema. However, there is insufficient information about other outcomes and side-effects hence it is difficult to be confident about the trade-offs for these benefits."
CD001069,"There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with preterms, neonates, and older infants to significantly manage pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures."
CD001073,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of D-penicillamine in the prevention of retinopathy of prematurity. The treatment of very low-birth-weight infants with D-penicillamine may be effective in preventing ROP.
CD001112,"Caffeine, when used as a primary treatment for asthma, may be associated with a small clinically significant benefit. However, the evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to develop adjunct trials that would allow researchers to gather evidence for both outcomes and harms."
CD001162,"Sulpiride appears to be beneficial for people with schizophrenia. In comparisons with haloperidol, the effects of this drug were more significant in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. However, there was no significant evidence for other outcomes. Clocapramine and perphenazine may be alternative treatments for psychotic symptoms. There is no significant evidence for other outcomes."
CD001168,"Pimecrolimus cream may be beneficial for the treatment of oral lichen planus. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific drug for the treatment of OLP. Other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of administration, costs and availability must therefore be taken into consideration in deciding the use of topical Ignatia in the treatment of OLP."
CD001261,"The Vi vaccine is effective in reducing side effects of oral immunisation, and in decreasing the risk of heat andphenol inactivated whole cell parenteral vaccine. It is more effective than the Ty21a oral typhoid vaccine in reducing adverse events, but it is not as effective as the Ty21a oral typhoid vaccine. In children, Vi is more effective in reducing side effects of oral immunisation than the Ty21"
CD001266,"The use of bronchodilators for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis is controversial. Many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of use of bronchodilators in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated. Salbutamol and ipratropium bromide may be useful in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. However, there is insufficient evidence from other trials and inconsistencies in the reporting of outcomes. Withdrawals due to"
CD001275,There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of laser treatment on wound healing in patients with spinal cord injury. The results suggest that laser treatment may be useful in treating pressure ulcers.
CD001293,There is evidence that different school-based prevention programs are different from each other. This heterogeneity between studies has implications for conclusions about the effectiveness of school-based prevention programs. There is evidence that different school-based prevention programs are different from each other.
CD001297,"Leuprolide when used as a primary therapy for endometriosis is effective, but the long term safety data on the use of this therapy is unknown. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the add-back groups despite the inability to tailor HRT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal add-back regimens with existing evidence are necessary, particularly for effects on bone mineral density."
CD001331,There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute multiple sclerosis. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD001332,"The previous version of this review showed that cannabinoids had a small clinically and statistically significant effect on spasticity in the treatment of chronic spasticity in multiple sclerosis. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of patients, cannabinoids do not increase the risk of adverse events."
CD001340,Extracorporeal circulation may be useful in treating newborn infants with respiratory failure. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm these findings.
CD001342,"Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that anticoagulation is effective in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke and in preventing secondary ischemic events other than stroke. Anticoagulation may be more effective than aspirin in preventing major bleeding. However, there is insufficient information about other outcomes and side-effects hence it is difficult to be confident about the trade-offs for these benefits."
CD001351,"The use of acupuncture for people with low-back pain is not new. However, this review provides some evidence that in a similar population of patients, acupuncture does not result in a significant reduction in pain, and may increase the risk of relapse. Further high quality RCTs evaluating the benefit of acupuncture for people with low-back pain are needed."
CD001367,"There is evidence from one trial that oral anticoagulant therapy is associated with a lower rate of recurrence than oral anticoagulation alone. This may be because anticoagulation is offered in a more convenient way than oral anticoagulation, and because of the lower mortality from venous thromboembolic events. There is no evidence that this effect is attributable to changes in the dose of anticoagulation, or that it is associated with an reduction in recurrence."
CD001418,"Since the last version of this review, new relevant studies have not provided additional information to change the conclusions. Published literature on the subject lacks the methodological rigour or robust reporting needed to make confident assessments of the role of cyclophosphamide in treatment of advanced ovarian cancer."
CD001419,"Adjuvant chemotherapy may be beneficial for patients with soft-tissue sarcoma. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of this therapy. In view of the small number of patients included in this review, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously."
CD001431,There is evidence that decision aids provide important information for decision making in the field of health care. There is a requirement for large scale RCTs of decision aids to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is evidence that decision aids provide important information for decision making in the field of health care.
CD001439,"The use of prophylaxis for patients undergoing appendectomy is effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative wound infection. However, there was little evidence from the prophylaxis trials on the period after appendectomy when infection was not prevented. There was a 10% and 34% reduction for patients receiving prophylaxis after appendectomy, respectively. However, these results were not statistically significant. The evidence base for these results is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of the outcomes."
CD001487,"There is unclear evidence that PTFE is superior to collagen-impregnated woven polyester as a bypass material in patients with claudication. However, there is no evidence that PTFE is superior to collagen-impregnated woven polyester as a bypass material in patients with stenosis. The"
CD001490,"Magnesium appears to be beneficial for patients with moderate to severe asthma who are not responding to conventional therapy. However, there is insufficient evidence for or against other magnesium treatments. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD001539,"The use of audiotapes to provide information to patients with cancer is not effective, and may be harmful. Audiotape benefit is not significantly related to patient satisfaction with communication, mood state or quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation, and is not significantly affected by choice of receiving the audiotape. Audiotape benefit is not significantly related to patient satisfaction with communication, mood state or quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation, and is not significantly affected by choice of receiving"
CD001543,"There is evidence from two randomised controlled trials that Shouldice is the most effective technique for hernia repair. The results suggest that shouldice repair is more effective than Bass or Lichtenstein in reducing recurrence rate and improving patient satisfaction. However, there is no evidence that Shouldice is more effective than Bass or Lichtenstein in reducing recurrence rate and improving patient satisfaction."
CD001691,"Higher-dose phenobarbital treatment is effective in reducing incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the routine administration of phenobarbital in the situation described. In view of the modest number of participants and small sample size, these results should be interpreted cautiously."
CD001694,Furosemide when administered in both parenteral and nebulised phases is an effective treatment for pulmonary function in preterm infants with chronic lung disease. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on the effectiveness of furosemide in improving pulmonary function in these infants.
CD001705,"There is evidence from one trial that compression may increase the rate of union when treating displaced femoral neck fractures. However, there is no evidence that the risk of AVN is increased when treating displaced femoral neck fractures with a sliding-screw-plate."
CD001715,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sertindole for patients with schizophrenia. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD001782,"Topical tretinoin cream is effective in reducing wrinkles and improving skin condition in people with photoaging. It is more effective than topical trichloroacetic acid in reducing the classical signs of photoaging, but it is not superior to topical tretinoin. In the treatment of photoaging, tretinoin is a well established but imperfect treatment. Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers"
CD001815,"Erythromycin appears to be beneficial for preterm infants with feeding intolerance. In comparisons with placebo, improvements in time taken to full enteral feeding was seen, with a reduction in the number of episodes of gastric reflux and cholestasis among the groups. However, there was no significant difference in time taken to establish full enteral feeding from the two studies. This update of the review does not contain any new trials published in full."
CD001831,"Cough and the common cold. To determine whether the cough of the common cold arises from upper respiratory stimuli and whether antihistamine-decongestant therapy is an effective treatment for this cough, we prospectively evaluated volunteers with uncomplicated common colds in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. There is no evidence of effect of antihistamine in the treatment of cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection. There is evidence of the effectiveness of antihistamine in the treatment of cough associated with chronic bronchop"
CD001874,"Bupivacaine appears to be beneficial for pain in adult tonsillectomy. However, there is no evidence for adverse effects from the use of bupivacaine in postoperative pain. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD001878,"The use of TT for headache is not effective, and further research is needed. TT may be more effective than relaxation, but with a poorer quality of result. TT may be more effective than relaxation, but with a poorer quality of result. TT may be more effective than relaxation, but with a poorer quality of result."
CD001896,"We have not found evidence that a specific type of presacral neurectomy is effective for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of presacral neurectomy for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea."
CD001900,"Adding REM to CBZ trials reduces the risk of serious adverse effects on CBZ activity and thus may be useful in preventing the adverse effects of REM. However, the long term safety data on the addition of REM to CBZ regimen is unknown. The method is offered as a model solution for problems caused by pharmacokinetic interactions in add-on trials."
CD001939,"Branched-chain amino acids appear to be beneficial for patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy. In comparisons with oral amino acids, improvements were seen in the rate of recovery of psychomotor function, attention, and metabolic function in the patients with chronic hepatic encephalopathy without an improvement in the rate of recovery of mental state."
CD001943,Loxapine appears to be similar to chlorpromazine in terms of efficacy and side effects. There is no evidence of adverse effects from Loxapine in patients with schizophrenia.
CD001946,There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of propranolol as a primary treatment for akathisia. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of propranolol in the treatment of NIA.
CD001983,"Corticosteroids are used for treating osteoporosis in patients with asthma. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of corticosteroids for this treatment. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes."
CD001984,Fibromyalgia treatment should be offered to people with non-specific pain.
CD001998,"There is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine administration of expectant management in the situation described. In the absence of evidence to support or refute the routine administration of expectant management in the situation described, further research is needed."
CD002008,"There is evidence that nutritional support provides important improvements in patients with cancer, but there is insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of nutritional support for people with cancer. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD002009,We found no clear evidence to support the use of any specific regimens for antipseudomonal therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large multi-centre trials of high methodological quality in order to define any benefit from once- versus three-times- daily tobramycin treatment in patients with CF.
CD002037,"We found some limited evidence to support the use of three- to four-drug antiretroviral maintenance regimens in HIV infected individuals. However, the evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to develop maintenance regimens that are more effective than three- to four-drug regimens."
CD002047,"Leflunomide appears to be beneficial for patients with RA. In comparisons with methotrexate, and sulfasalazine, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of functional ability, combined adverse events and clinical outcomes in patients with RA. This could be because of the small number of participants in the trials, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes."
CD002053,Clonidine may be a useful adjunct to pharmacotherapy for infants born to drug-dependent women. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD002055,"Colloid infusions may be effective in preventing intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants. However, there is insufficient information about other outcomes and side-effects hence it is difficult to be confident about the trade-offs for these benefits. There seems little evidence in favour of non-opioid transfusion in preterm infants compared to either dopamine or albumin, but the data are sparse. More trials are needed in preterm infants compared to other outcomes and side-effects,"
CD002068,Clodronate may be useful for treating bone pain in patients with bone metastases from prostatic cancer.
CD002073,"Amnioreduction may be more effective than laser therapy for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. It may be more effective than selective fetoscopic laser coagulation of the communicating vessels on the chorionic plate. However, each randomised trial identified represents a different clinical setting in this syndrome and further research is needed."
CD002085,Does an encouraging letter encourage attendance at psychiatric out-patient clinics? The aim was to reduce non-attendance for first-time consultations at psychiatric out-patient clinics. The orientation statement significantly reduces the numbers of people failing to attend
CD002095,"Omeprazole is more effective than cimetidine for symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

In patients with non-erosive reflux disease, omeprazole is more effective in terms of symptom relief than endoscopy-related"
CD002113,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the value of behaviour therapy for elderly people. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.
CD002122,"Gestrinone appears to be equally effective as danazol for the symptoms of endometriosis. In women with endometriosis without a predisposing risk of serious adverse events, gestrinone tends to be more effective in terms of lower serum concentrations and less effective in terms of higher side effects. However, there is limited information regarding the effectiveness of gestrinone compared to oral contraceptive methods or other hormonal treatments in women with endometri"
CD002139,"Adjuvant chemotherapy may offer a significant improvement in survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. However, most of the studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate"
CD002179,Two studies show SU-5 inhibitor treatment effective in children. One study showed oxatomide may be effective in children with beneficial effects on respiratory function and sleep were observed.
CD002200,There is no evidence of effect of intensive follow-up on survival and recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer who have undergone curative resection. This may explain why there is limited evidence of benefit of intensive follow-up in patients with colon cancer.
CD002208,"Higher-dose methadone treatment is more effective than low-dose methadone treatment in reducing use of illicit drugs and in decreasing the risk of death. However, high-dose methadone treatment is more effective than low-dose methadone in reducing use of illicit drugs and in decreasing the risk of death. However, high-dose methadone treatment is more effective than low-dose methadone"
CD002214,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of nurse-led intermediate care for the chronically critically ill. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from the use of nurse-led intermediate care regarding length of stay, mortality, and whether or not patients are better prepared for discharge."
CD002217,"Phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine are highly effective in controlling seizures. However, they have a long term effect on health and there is a risk of side effects, which may explain why they are not frequently used. Withdrawals due to side-effects were less with phenytoin than with PB or carbamazepine. However, these results are not cumulative and may be interpreted to be inconsistent."
CD002224,"Groin dissection may be more effective than groin radiation in treating squamous carcinoma of the vulva. However, there was little evidence from the trials on the period after groin dissection was compared to the period after groin radiation. Radiation of the intact groins is significantly inferior to groin dissection in patients with squamous carcinoma of the vulva and N0-1 nodes."
CD002230,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about pimobendan 's lack of efficacy in chronic heart failure did not change. Given availability of more effective treatments including phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy and newer inotropic agents, pimobendan does not have a significant place in therapy based on available evidence."
CD002231,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of Phyllanthus amarus in the treatment of chronic carriers of hepatitis B. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]

CD002255,"Nifedipine appears to be an efficacious alternative to ritodrine for the treatment of threatened preterm labour. In comparisons with other tocolytic drugs, side effects were consistent with the use of ritodrine. There was no significant difference in neonatal outcomes between nifedipine and ritodrine. The choice of whether to use nifedipine as a primary treatment for threatened preterm labour and whether it has advantages over"
CD002265,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of cyclophosphamide as a treatment for acute, severe NPSLE. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field."
CD002271,There is evidence from one trial that CPAP reduces the mortality and respiratory outcomes in infants with severe hyaline membrane disease. The evidence is not significant for CIP alone.
CD002277,Immunoglobulin has a clinically significant effect in patients with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis. It is more effective than plasma exchange (for 21 days) but with a smaller effect on QMGS. The QMGS improvement in MG -treated patients is less significant than that in plasma exchange (for 21 days) but with a smaller effect on QMGS.
CD002280,"The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. dental caries may be improved with the use of topical fluoride gels.

CD004538,"We found that CAHPS information does not significantly improve hospital volume when used as a basis for deciding on a plan. However, it does increase the risk of heart failure, and may have implications for health care quality. In view of the modest number of cases studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if CAHPS information improves hospital volume when used as a basis for deciding on a plan."

CD004572,Tolrestat appears to be beneficial for patients with mild to moderate diabetic neuropathy. The beneficial effects of Tolrestat on neuropathy appear to be modest compared to the effects of aldose reductase inhibitor treatment. This may be because most of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s. Recent evidence suggests that the aldose reductase inhibitor effects of Tolrestat may be less robust than that of sorbinil. This may be because most of the trials were done in the 1970

This update of the review provides additional evidence that in the ICSI-ET cycles, GnRH agonists may be beneficial for luteal support. There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased adverse events in women undergoing IVF"
CD009190,There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of telephonic psycho-social support on adherence to PEP. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed interventions in rape survivors.
CD009192,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any method of telephone notification for high-risk youth. The use of any method of telephone notification for high-risk youth is likely to increase the number of youths receiving their HIV test results and post-test counseling.
CD009202,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of barbiturates in the treatment of RSE. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD009274,"Topical corticosteroids can reduce symptoms of CRS in a similar way to oral corticosteroids, but without the benefit of a steroids-free outcome. There is no evidence that the immune response to topical corticosteroids is different from that to placebo. These results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies."
CD009275,A diet rich in monounsaturated fats is effective in reducing glycemic control in women with gestational diabetes. It reduces the need for insulin treatment and may be useful in preventing hyperglycaemia. A small study of appropriate size is needed to determine the effects of dietary MUFA on glycemic control in women with GDM.
CD009308,"Interventions designed to reduce substance use in adolescent girls are effective, with significant effects on rate of change in attitudes about drug use and frequency of use, and in the use of drugs. However, there was no significant effect on rate of change in parents' attitudes about drug use and their children's substance use, and no significant effect on parents' attitudes about drug use and their children's substance use. There were however some significant effects on parents' perception of their daughters' substance use and their perception of the risk of drug use, which may have"
CD009379,"Amniotic membrane transplantation appears to be beneficial for patients with moderate burns. In comparisons with control groups, rate of epithelial healing and the rate of vascularisation were seen. However, these results were not statistically significant. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of amniotic membrane transplantation."
CD009404,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of educational program for people undergoing tooth extraction in Taiwan.
CD009415,There is evidence from one trial that zinc supplementation reduces incidence of infections and may reduce length of hospital stay in patients with SCD. This results from a single trial. There is no evidence that zinc supplementation reduces incidence of infections and may reduce length of hospital stay in patients with SCD.
CD009461,"Implications for practice There is evidence that polypectomy, especially when performed in the position of the uterine fibroid, may improve pregnancy rates and pregnancy maintenance in women with endometrial polyps."
CD009593,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that Xpert MTB/RIF is a highly effective means of detecting tuberculosis in pre-processed clinical samples. It is more effective than Cepheid MTB/RIF due to its high sensitivity and specificity, and is associated with lower incidence of disease and adverse effects. However, it is not associated with lower incidence of disease and adverse effects. The use of Xpert MT"
CD009755,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of zinc supplements for HIV- infected women. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
CD009792,There is evidence from one trial that misoprostol may be associated with a high frequency of uterine rupture and adverse effects on the already-existing flora. Further trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal use of misoprostol in women with previous cesarean delivery.
CD010256,"Salbutamol, when given in a combined infusion with aminophylline and terbutamol, is equally effective as corticosteroids alone. No significant differences were found in respiratory outcomes between aminophylline and salbutamol, although they did not show a significant effect. Peak expiratory flow rates were consistent with the combined infusion, although this was not always the case. No significant differences were found in respiratory outcomes between"
CD010257,"Antibiotic therapy for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not effective, and may be associated with a higher rate of failure. There is no high quality evidence that antibiotic therapy improves symptoms of COPD, and further research is needed."
CD010292,"Milnacipran appears to be beneficial for the pain of people with FM. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of improvement of pain, severity and quality of life. The improvement in pain, area under the curve of pain relief and patient satisfaction was also associated with greater treatment-related adverse events. Most of the side-effects were minor and transient. Insufficient evidence was available on adverse events."
CD010610,"Topiramate appears to be beneficial for people with frequent migraine. In comparisons with prophylaxis, topiramate showed a statistically significant advantage for the number of days with migraine, but was not associated with an improvement in overall migraine frequency. The use of topiramate for preventive migraine is still unclear."
CD010611,"Valproic acid appears to be effective for migraine. In comparisons with placebo, reductions in frequency of headache attacks, and the number of migraine headache days were seen, although results were not always significant. Adverse events were generally minor and transient. A trans-Atlantic crossover study of appropriate size is needed to confirm the results of this review."
