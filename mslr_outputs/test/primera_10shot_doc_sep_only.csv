CD009109,There is little evidence to suggest that a mortality benefit could be had from the use of direct composite restoration in the endodontically treated premolars restored with fiber posts and restorations. There is no apparent reduction in the failure rates of endodontically treated premolars restored with fiber posts and restorations when compared with no intervention or no restorations.
CD009110,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of Ca guided wound dressing on ulcers compared with no intervention or Ca guided wound dressing.
CD009118,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from the use of polyethylene glycol in the treatment of children with functional constipation. There is a small but definite mortality benefit from oral polyethylene glycol in the treatment of children with constipation.
CD009153,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on the risk of HIV-1 transmission among HIV-1 infected people and their lesbian partners.
CD009154,We have not found evidence that a significant benefit has been gained from the administration of progesterone during the luteal phase of IVF cycles. This is based on a small number of studies.
CD009190,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of psycho-social support on adherence to PEP.
CD009192,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of telephone notification on the rates of HIV and post-test counseling in high-risk and homeless youth.
CD009202,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit from propofol treatment of RSE is significantly different from control groups or colon ischemia after barbiturates.
CD009274,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of rhinosinusitis. The results suggest that topical corticosteroids may improve nasal congestion and discharge scores in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis that has persisted despite appropriate surgical intervention.
CD009275,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of calorie restriction on diabetes outcomes and glucose concentration in women with gestational diabetes. The results suggest that a moderate calorie restriction may improve glucose tolerance in affected women.
CD009308,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from parent intervention in adolescent girls. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of intervention in preventing drug use among adolescent girls."
CD009379,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of amniotic membrane transplantation on outcomes of ocular burns in people with moderate and severe burns.
CD009404,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program comprising case-based materials, information feedback and clinical guidelines in reducing the incidence of wrong-site tooth extraction."
CD009415,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from oral zinc supplementation in adult patients with sickle cell anemia.
CD009461,We have not found evidence that a reduction in pregnancy rates was achieved by the removal of fibroid prior to conception.
CD009593,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between Xpert MTB/RIF assay and other methods for the detection of tuberculosis in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. The results suggest that the Xpert MTB/RIF assay is effective in detecting tuberculosis in patients with advanced immunodeficiency while avoiding the need for expensive and error-prone tests.
CD009755,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from oral vitamin A and multivitamins in HIV-infected pregnant women.
CD009792,"We have not found evidence to support the use of misoprostol for induction of labor in women with previous cesarean delivery. Although induction of labor in is controversial, we compared misoprostol ORY to oxytocin in such women in a randomized trial. The results suggest that the use of misoprostol may result in miscarriage or fetal heart tones during labor."
CD010256,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit from oral salbutamol is gained from the use of aminophylline in the treatment of acute asthmatic children with severe asthma.
CD010257,Exacerbations of respiratory disease are more likely to be resistant to antibiotic therapy than are those caused by viral infections. This is based on evidence from randomized controlled trials.
CD010292,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of fibromyalgia. The results suggest that a higher proportion of fibromyalgia patients improved pain under the guidance of the Expert Panel on Pain Inventory (BPI).
CD010610,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in migraine frequency was achieved with the use of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis compared with no intervention or placebo.
CD010611,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of valproate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. The results suggest that a small number of patients may benefit from oral valproate compared to placebo.
