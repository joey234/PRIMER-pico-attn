CD000116,There is a lack of evidence to suggest that intrapartum fetal monitoring reduces the rate of bleeding during pregnancy or reduces the respiratory disturbances during childbirth. This could be because the ST Waveform of the fetal electrocardiogram is more easily accessible than traditional methods of monitoring. Further evidence from randomized controlled trials is required to assess the effectiveness of intrapartum fetal monitoring compared with other methods such as ultrasound or ultrasound.
CD000123,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from oral polytherapy in patients with peripheral neuropathy when compared with no intervention or placebo.

CD000146,There is little evidence to suggest that a higher nicotine concentration cigarette replacement therapy is effective in preventing smoking relapse than alternative treatments such as oral appliances or oral appliances. This is based on a small but very important sample size and the fact that the trials were underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between treatments. Further evidence from contemporary trials is required.
CD000168,We found no evidence that a significant benefit was gained from the use of skin traction in patients with moderate and severe fractures when compared to no intervention or skin traction.

CD000255,There is little evidence to suggest that a mortality benefit exists from the use of anticoagulation in patients with peripheral neuropathy. This is because the outcomes are more variable than those between the two groups. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the studies and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from contemporary studies is required in order to assess the effectiveness of anticoagulation in patients with peripheral neuropathy properly.

CD000436,Exercise-induced asthma occurs in approximately 90% of people with moderate and severe disease. The results suggest that a small increase in dietary salt consumption may result in increased respiratory disturbances in people with moderate and severe disease. This could be because of the way in which sodium is metabolized in the body.

CD001351,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of low back pain with needles or epidural analgesia in patients with peripheral neuropathy. This was demonstrated by the small numbers of studies to date.
CD001367,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the benefits/reversibility of oral anticoagulation for patients with venous thrombinosis after a first episode of venous thrombinosis.

The small increases in CBZ concentration that occurred in spite of this procedure were of similar magnitude in responders (patients who experienced > or =50% reduction in during treatment) and nonresponders, and in both groups the mean increase was <1 mg/L. The results suggest that REM could improve the outcomes of patients with refractory epilepsy by reducing CB"

The results suggest that both treatments have a clinically significant effect 4 weeks out in patients with gravis. This could be because both treatments are effective in reducing inflammation and improving blood pressure.
CD002280,The results suggest that topical fluoride could be effective in reducing tooth decay in people with predisposed tooth decay when applied topically or orally. This could be because the oral appliances used to apply topical fluoride are less expensive than oral appliances used to apply topical fluoride when applied orally or orally. This could be because the oral appliances used to apply topical fluoride are less expensive than oral appliances used to apply topical fluoride when applied orally or orally.

CD004878,There is little evidence to suggest that oral Corticosteroids are effective in preventing bronchiolitis and the subsequent respiratory disturbances. The results suggest that oral Corticles may be effective in preventing bronchiolitis and the subsequent respiratory disturbances. This could be because the two drugs are more effective than oral Corticles in preventing bronchiolitis.
CD004884,The results suggest that prophylactic antibiotics may be effective in preventing meningitis in patients with mild head injury and pneumocephalus from developing infections. This is based on a small sample size and examination of the relevant data.

The results suggest that a reduction in NIDDM could be achieved by administering dietary dietary intervention during the first year of treatment."
CD005129,We have not found evidence that a reduction in CMV infection occurred from the use of prophylaxis in patients when TCVS is administered. This is based on a small but very important sample size and the absence or apparentifference to the use of other antiepileptic drugs such as perioperative and prophylaxis when administering TCVS when TCVS is administered.

Further larger and longer-term trials are required to evaluate the effectiveness of paradoxical intention treatment in other disorders such as schizophrenia and Tourette’s in later life.
CD005365,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylaxis in preventing postoperative infections. The results suggest that a higher rate of infection was observed in the groups compared with no intervention or no intervention in the two eligible studies. This could be because the two eligible studies were more equivocal about the effectiveness of each one.

Further evidence from contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of CBT in reducing reports of maltreatment of children by parents and caregivers properly."
CD005486,The results suggest that the use of fluorides dressing in wounds may have a clinically beneficial effect on wound infection rates. This is based on a small sample size and the absence or apparent superior outcomes in the two eligible studies. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to compare fluorides dressing with other wound dressing alternatives such as topical wound dressing or local anaesthetic topical wound dressing with alternative adjuvant classes of drug in order to assess the effectiveness of these in larger and more contemporary trials.
CD005496,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of oral probiotics on colon colonization and colonitis in infants.

CD005538,We investigated the effect of postoperative analgesia on patients with peripheral neuropathy. The results suggest that a more effective analgesia is possible with the possible aid of oral appliances or epidural analgesia. This could be because the two are more effective than oral appliances in reducing pain after postoperative. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of controlling postoperative nausea and vomiting.
