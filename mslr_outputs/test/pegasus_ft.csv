447,CD009109,There is no evidence to support the use of adhesive techniques for the restoration of premolars with adhesive or composite restorations. The use of adhesive techniques for the restoration of premolars with adhesive or composite restorations is associated with a higher failure rate than with adhesive restorations.
448,CD009110,There is no evidence to support the use of alginate dressings in the management of diabetic foot ulcers.
449,CD009118,There is no evidence to support the use of lactulose in the treatment of chronic constipation in children.
450,CD009153,There is no evidence to suggest that HIV transmission of HIV from infected heterosexual couples to their uninfected partners is reduced by ART initiation. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies included in this review. The results suggest that ART initiation may have a small effect on the risk of HIV transmission in heterosexual couples.
451,CD009154,"There is no evidence to support the use of dydrogesterone for luteal phase support in ART cycles. However, there is a suggestion that luteal supplementation may be beneficial in women with low late-midluteal estradiol levels."
452,CD009190,There is no evidence to support the use of psychosocial interventions to improve adherence to PEP in rape survivors. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for HIV prevention in rape survivors.
453,CD009192,"Telephone notification of HIV test results in high-risk youth is associated with a higher proportion of receiving post-test counseling and post-test counseling than face-to-face notification. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the lack of data on the effect of the different methods of notification."
454,CD009202,There is no evidence to support the use of barbiturates in the treatment of RSE.
455,CD009274,There is no evidence to support the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. The use of systemic corticosteroids in chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than with placebo.
456,CD009275,"There is no evidence to support the use of calorie restriction in the management of GDM. The use of calorie restriction in the management of GDM is associated with a reduction in glycaemic control and a reduction in the occurrence of glycaemic complications. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small sample sizes. The results of the included studies suggest that calorie restriction may have a role in improving glycaemic control and improving adherence to dietary advice."
457,CD009308,"There is some evidence that family interventions can reduce the initiation of alcohol and tobacco use among adolescents. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies included in this review and the heterogeneity of the interventions studied. The evidence is not strong enough to support the widespread implementation of family interventions for preventing alcohol and tobacco use among adolescents."
458,CD009379,There is no evidence to support the use of amniotic membrane transplantation in patients with acute ocular burns. Further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment for acute ocular burns.
459,CD009404,There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of educational interventions for preventing wrong-site tooth extraction.
460,CD009415,There is no evidence that zinc supplementation reduces the risk of sickle cell crisis in sickle cell disease. Further trials are needed to confirm or refute the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in sickle cell disease.
461,CD009461,There is no evidence to support the use of hysterectomy for the treatment of uterine fibroids prior to IUI.
462,CD009593,The RIF-MTB test is superior to other rapid tests in detecting tuberculosis in people with suspected tuberculosis. The RIF-MTB test is superior to other rapid tests in detecting tuberculosis in people with HIV infection. The RIF-MTB test is superior to other rapid tests in detecting tuberculosis in people with HIV infection.
463,CD009755,"There is no evidence that multivitamin supplementation reduces the risk of low birthweight or preterm birth in HIV-infected pregnant women. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose of vitamin A, selenium, zinc, and copper for HIV-infected pregnant women."

465,CD010256,"The use of intravenous aminophylline in children with acute asthma is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower rate of serious adverse events compared with intravenous salbutamol. However, the effect of aminophylline on the length of hospital stay is not clear."
466,CD010257,There is no evidence that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small sample sizes. The evidence is not strong enough to support routine use of antibiotics in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD.
467,CD010292,"Duloxetine 60 mg daily is an effective treatment for pain and fibromyalgia, but the evidence is limited by the small number of trials and the small sample sizes. The small number of trials and small sample sizes limit the usefulness of this review to draw firm conclusions."
468,CD010610,"Topiramate is effective in reducing the frequency of episodic migraine attacks, but the effect is small and may be due to a small number of patients. The effect is not clear on the frequency of attacks."
