CD000024,"Heparin appears to be an effective prophylaxis against deep-vein thrombosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of heparin as a primary prevention of DVT. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, heparin appears to be associated with a higher frequency of venous thrombosis than placebo. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of heparin in such patients."
CD000074,"Theophylline appears to be beneficial for the short-term treatment of apnea in pre-term infants. However, long-term data are lacking. A trial comparing theophylline with doxapram for the treatment of apnea of prematurity is warranted."
CD000116,"There is evidence that intrapartum fetal monitoring may reduce the rate of neonatal acidemia, the rate of operative intervention and the incidence of FBS during labour. However, there is no evidence that intrapartum monitoring reduces the rate of C-sections, hepatic deliveries or newborn admissions."
CD000123,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with peripheral vascular disease, cholesterollowering drugs can improve walking performance. In the absence of evidence that a significant benefit exists from long-term therapy with cholesterollowering drugs, these studies should be classed as ""controlled"" trials. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform randomised trials on outcomes such asClaudication symptoms, adverse events and adverse effects."
CD000143,There is evidence that N-CPAP is effective in reducing the need for additional ventilatory support in preterm infants following extubation. This is based on randomised controlled trials in which control groups are given either N-CPAP or oxygen administered via a headbox. There is no evidence that the use of N-CPAP is associated with an increase in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage or that of oxygen dependency at 28 days.
CD000146,Higher doses of nicotine replacement therapy are more effective than lower doses in inducing quit rates. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence is available from randomised controlled trials of any kind.
CD000168,There is evidence that skin traction provides a limited analgesia in patients with proximal femoral fractures. This finding is consistent with previous evidence that skin traction does not provide a significant analgesia in patients with proximal femoral fractures. There is no evidence that skin traction provides a significant analgesia in patients with displaced cervical and trochanteric hip fractures. These patients may be candidates for randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of skin traction in alleviating pain.
CD000220,Treatment of symptomatic trichomoniasis in pregnant women with antibiotics is ineffective. The risk of preterm delivery and other adverse outcomes is increased with antibiotic treatment of symptomatic trichomoniasis.
CD000238,"There is evidence that supplemental oxygen increases exercise performance in the short term in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild hypoxemia. However, there is no evidence that this effect translates into improved quality of life. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of patients included in the current study and the small sizes of the included studies. Further large-scale studies are needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from supplemental oxygen who are not obese or who have other health issues."
CD000246,"Antibiotic therapy for preterm labour and intact membranes is ineffective, and in some cases harmful. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm this."
CD000254,"Higher intakes of antioxidants and trace minerals (i.e. vitamins, minerals, and trace minerals) are associated with better visual function in people with AMD. However, the evidence from these studies is limited due to the small number of participants and the short follow-up. Further high quality, fully powered studies are needed to confirm the trends of improvement identifed in studies so far."
CD000255,There is no high quality evidence to support or refute the routine routine routine routine routine routine routine PCI dissection of internal carotid arteries. It is not clear that the risk of death or recurrence is increased in the following years following spontaneous CICA. The risk of stroke or myoclonus is increased in the following years after spontaneous CICA.
CD000259,There is evidence that feedback can improve the quality of primary care practice drug prescribing.
CD000297,"Corticosteroids are effective for short-term treatment of Crohn's disease. However, there is insufficient evidence for long-term treatment of the disease. Cyclosporine may be beneficial for long-term treatment of Crohn's disease if used in a well-designed trial. However, there is insufficient evidence for long-term treatment of the disease. In the absence of evidence to support more powerful corticosteroids, cyclosporine should be considered as a second-line treatment for Crohn's. Short-term treatment of Crohn's disease is effective in reducing symptoms and improving health-related quality of"
CD000305,"The anticoagulant effects of heparin, when taken in low dose, appear to be modest compared to the effects of anticoagulant drugs such as antiseptics. However, heparin does not seem to be associated with an increase in the risk of pulmonary embolism or bleeding. Given that these results are not statistically significant, it is difficult to arrive at definitive conclusions. Until further evidence is established, I recommend that patients with proximal femoral fractures be offered entry into a clinical trial in order to confirm the 0-hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of heparin."
CD000345,"There is evidence that corticosteroid therapy is effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In a review of randomized controlled trials including 42 patients with documented hepatitis B, the authors found that corticosteroid therapy is effective in reducing inflammation and reducing liver damage. However, there is no evidence that the results seen in the trials are indicative of the overall effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy."
CD000369,"There is no evidence that natural beta interferon prevents acute hepatitis C from becoming chronic. There is evidence that natural beta interferon may increase the risk of liver damage in patients with acute hepatitis C. However, there is no evidence that this is the case with natural beta interferon."
CD000405,"There is some evidence that oral vancomycin may be effective for the prevention of neonatal necrotising enterocolitis. However, this is based on a small study and conclusions should be drawn with caution. Further studies are needed to confirm the results of the study and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of oral vancomycin."
CD000409,We found some limited evidence of use of academic detailing in improving antibiotic prescribing. This may be because the information is so sparse and because the practice of prescribing antibiotics is soynical. There was no evidence of changes in antibiotic prescribing after educational visits.
CD000432,"Early administration of caffeine reduces the risk of systemic hypoxaemia in preterm infants, and may have benefits on postmenstrual outcomes. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of caffeine for these purposes. The risk of systemic hypoxaemia in preterm infants is not significantly affected by caffeine, and further research is needed."
CD000436,"There is some indication that dietary salt may be associated with an increase in pulmonary function in people with asthma. In a crossover study of high methodological rigour, results showed that people with exercise-induced asthma were more likely to be obese and more likely to experience cardiovascular disease. The results suggest that people with exercise-induced asthma are more likely to be obese and more likely to experience cardiovascular disease."
CD000460,"There is evidence that tartrazine is effective in treating asthma. In patients with asthma who are not smokers, tartrazine may be useful in treating symptoms of short-term asthma. However, most of the patients were not smokers and tartrazine may not be beneficial in treating short-term asthma. Further studies are needed to determine if there is a benefit of tartrazine challenge in children with asthma."
CD000479,"There is evidence that occlusion of the vena spermatica by surgical or angiographic techniques is effective in improving sperm density, motility and morphology in male partners with varicocele. However, there is no evidence that this treatment is more effective than no treatment. In addition, there is evidence that the sperm concentration and motility increase after varicocelectomy but there is no evidence that this is associated with a higher pregnancy rate. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of different treatments forvaricocele."
CD000483,"Hypervolemic therapy of either HV or normovolemic therapy of either HV or NV is effective in reducing the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia. However, there is no evidence of a reduction in other outcomes. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from hypervolemic therapy in preventing delayed ischemic neurological deficits."
CD000491,There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of single-dose antibiotic therapy for bacteriuria in pregnant women. This is based on randomised controlled trials. No evidence was found for the effectiveness or effectiveness of multiple-dose antibiotic therapy for bacteriuria in pregnant women.
CD000525,"There is evidence that haloperidol is effective in the treatment of acutely disturbed schizophrenics. Zuclopenthixol acetate appears to be effective in the treatment of acutely disturbed schizophrenics. However, there is no evidence in the side effects."
CD000536,The administration of oral anticoagulation therapy to patients with peripheral arterial bypass surgery is effective in preventing early occlusion. The effectiveness of oral anticoagulation is associated with lower mortality and morbidity. Patients with a predisposing risk of stroke are advised to continue with oral anticoagulation.
CD000567,"There is evidence that different saline-based resuscitative solutions are effective in differentiating patients from different clinical groups and in differentiating outcomes. In patients with sepsis, the evidence is more equivocal."
CD000934,"There is evidence that a new model of routine antenatal care in some countries reduces the number of visits, referrals and interventions used in the care of pregnant women. This may have implications for the quality of care provided in these settings. There is no evidence that the new model reduces the use of healthcare services overall or perinatal outcomes."
CD000948,"We found no clear evidence to support or refute the use of either orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation in the treatment of acute ventilatory distress. In patients with respiratory problems who were intubated, the risk of death is similar for both routes."
CD000972,dexamethasone is an oral medication used in some clinical trials for treating malaria. One trial showed a mortality benefit from dexamethasone in patients with severe malaria. There is no evidence that the drug reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and serious adverse outcomes in patients with severe malaria. The risk of all-cause mortality is higher in patients with severe malaria treated with dexamethasone.
CD000978,There is evidence that homeopathic remedies can reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients undergoing marrow transplantation. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of remedy.
CD000980,"vitamin C supplementation, when used in both low- and high-dose, appears to reduce the frequency of common colds and its severity. However, there is insufficient information about other side-effects and side-effects, and the results should be interpreted with caution. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm the findings of this review."
CD000996,"Corticosteroid therapy is effective in reducing the symptoms of bronchiectasis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of corticosteroid therapy in improving bronchiectasis. In the absence of evidence to support or not support the use of corticosteroid therapy in improving bronchiectasis, clinicians should be cautious in recommending any specific type of corticosteroid therapy in patients with bronchiectasis. Short-term data are needed to support or not support the use of corticosteroid therapy in improving the quality of life of patients with bronchiectasis."
CD001005,There is evidence that educational programs providing information about asthma can reduce the use of emergency services by people with asthma. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of interventions.
CD001018,"There is evidence that estrogen plus progestin reduces hot flushes, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other adverse outcomes in women with menopausal symptoms. However, there is no evidence that this reduction is permanent. Women may experience side effects such as breast pain, breast cancer, and menstrual bleeding. This is because the estrogen-releasing progestins are more active than the non-releasing progestins. Women may experience more side effects than the non-releasing progestins. These women may experience more side effects than the estrogen-releasing progestins. The risk of endometrial and"
CD001024,Tamoxifen appears to be beneficial for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is needed to confirm these findings.
CD001036,There is no high quality evidence that a specific cervical spatula is superior to a traditional cytobrush. There is limited evidence that a specific cervical spatula is superior to a non-spatial cytobrush. There is no evidence that a specific cervical spatula is superior to a non- spatial cytobrush.
CD001046,"Treatment with methylprednisolone or naloxone in the first 8 hours after whiplash injury is effective in improving neurologic recovery in patients with acute spinal-cord injury. However, the results of the review did not show a significant difference in the rate of disability or death for patients treated with methylprednisolone or naloxone in the first eight hours. This is because the symptoms of whiplash injury are often severe and lasting, and treatment immediately after injury is not effective. Short-term treatment with methylprednisolone or naloxone in the first eight hours of injury"
CD001055,"There is no evidence to support the use of hypnosis for smoking cessation in pregnancy. There is limited evidence to support the use of hypnosis for smoking cessation in other settings, such as nursing or caregiving. Where possible, researchers recommend using validated methods such as cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness to support smoking cessation in pregnancy."
CD001059,"calcium supplementation during pregnancy is not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension, or neonatal mortality. A single trial suggests that calcium supplementation may reduce the risk of these outcomes."
CD001062,There is some indication that abdominal decompression may be useful for women with pre-eclampsia. This is based on small studies.
CD001066,There is no evidence of effect of reflexology on symptom relief in women with chronic pain or in pregnancy. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of reflexology on pain or in pregnancy. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of reflexology on pain or in pregnancy.
CD001069,There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with preterm infants to manage pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures. One intervention that shows significant benefit in pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures is the use of a sucrose-coated pacifier during acutely painful procedures. This intervention appears to be effective in reducing pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures in preterm infants.
CD001073,There is evidence that D-penicillamine may be effective for prevention of ROP in very low-birth-weight-infants. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design.
CD001112,There is evidence that caffeine may be beneficial for asthma in the short term. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm this.
CD001162,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of sulpiride in people with schizophrenia. In comparisons with other antipsychotics, the differences between sulpiride and other preparations were small and there were no clear differences between preparations. The beneficial effects of sulpiride in people with schizophrenia need to be evaluated in blinded trials."
CD001168,There is no high quality evidence that topical pimecrolimus is effective for the treatment of oral lichen planus. There is a small evidence that it may be effective for the treatment of pain.
CD001261,There is evidence that the meningococcal CPS vaccine is effective in preventing typhoid fever. The protective efficacy of the meningococcal CPS vaccine is higher than the protective efficacy of the meningococcal CPS vaccine.
CD001266,There is evidence that some drugs are effective for the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis. One study found that albuterol is effective in the management of bronchiolitis. There is no evidence that the drug is effective in the treatment of infants with recurrent wheezing. There is evidence that the drug is effective in the management of infants with first-time wheezing.
CD001275,There is some indication that laser treatment may be effective for the treatment of pressure ulcers in patients with spinal cord injury. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of treatment methods.
CD001293,"The two interventions studied in this review did not show a significant effect on the rate of use of tobacco, although the results suggest that it is possible to influence attitudes towards tobacco use. Adequately powered studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of interventions in different age groups and settings."
CD001297,"HRT is effective in reducing symptoms of endometriosis and in reducing the risk of serious adverse effects on physical and mental health. However, endometriosis does not respond well to HRT, and so the choice of whether to use HRT in conjunction with goserelin acetate may be less effective. HRT is effective in reducing symptoms of endometriosis and in reducing the risk of serious adverse effects on physical and mental health. However, endometriosis does not respond well to HRT, and so the choice of whether to use HRT in conjunction with goserelin acetate may be"
CD001331,There is evidence that methylprednisolone may be beneficial for people with early episodes of multiple sclerosis. The beneficial effects appear to be modest compared to drugs such as parenteral methylprednisolone or oral methylprednisolone. These drugs are not effective in treating early episodes of MS. There is no evidence that methylprednisolone is effective in treating early episodes of MS.
CD001332,We found no evidence of effects of botulinum toxin on long term outcomes in patients with chronic sclerosis. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of new drugs in this field.
CD001340,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of ECMO in treating neonates with respiratory failure. In comparisons with standard care, the results show a significant benefit for infants with severe respiratory failure. The benefit of ECMO appears to be significant in patients with severe respiratory failure who are not already on mechanical ventilator support."
CD001342,"The two trials included in this review provide evidence that aspirin is superior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with symptomatic arterial stenosis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of aspirin as a primary treatment for ischemic stroke. In patients with a prior ischemic stroke, aspirin is superior to warfarin in the prevention of major hemorrhage. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of aspirin as a primary treatment for ischemic stroke."
CD001351,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any interventions for people with chronic pain. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001367,"There is evidence that long-term anticoagulation therapy, especially prophylactic oral anticoagulation, is associated with a lower rate of recurrence than short-term anticoagulation. However, there is no evidence that this is true for all patients. Long-term anticoagulation may be associated with a higher rate of major bleeding than short-term anticoagulation."
CD001418,"Cisplatin-containing polychemotherapy may have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit over cisplatin alone when used in stage III-IV ovarian cancer. However, the data on mortality and progression are not very good and the choice of CAP in this setting may well be a decision made by the clinical trial organisers. The low-dose cyclophosphamide compared with cyclophosphamide alone when used in stage III-IV ovarian cancer is less evidence for a benefit than the high-dose CAP but the data on mortality and progression are not very good."
CD001419,"There is no evidence to suggest that chemotherapy leads to better outcomes than local chemotherapy, when used in combination with radiological treatment or other adjuvant treatment. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and lack of standardisation in the choice of chemotherapy regimen. Adequately powered trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in improving outcomes in people with high-grade sarcomas of the extremities."
CD001431,"There is some indication that the use of educational videotapes may be beneficial for patients undergoing treatment for coronary angiography. However, the data on outcomes are limited and conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD001439,"The use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis is justified based on current evidence. However, the quality and quantity of studies included in the review did not allow conclusions about the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. Further studies are needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis."
CD001487,There is evidence that the use of a cuff for the occlusion of arivals is associated with a lower patency rate than a non-cuffed graft. This finding is consistent with previous evidence that the use of a cuff for the occlusion of arivals is associated with a lower patency rate than a non-cuffed graft. The evidence to date may justify the development and evaluation of a cuff for the occlusion of arivals.
CD001490,There is evidence that magnesium sulfate administered in the form of a bolus or infusion decreases admission rate and improve expiratory flow in patients with acute asthma but does not show significant improvement in patients with moderate asthma. This finding is based on a single trial and does not exclude the possibility that magnesium sulfate administration may be effective in patients with moderate asthma but not in those with severe asthma. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of magnesium sulfate in patients with acute asthma.
CD001539,"There is evidence that audio-taped consultations can improve patient perception of being informed about clinical trials, knowledge of information relevant to providing informed consent to a clinical trial, and satisfaction with communication during the consultation. This finding should lead to the development of better audiotapes that will better inform patients about the quality of clinical trial consultation information and their ability to participate."
CD001543,"There is inconclusive evidence for the superiority of Shouldice for hernia repair in comparison to any other technique. In men, Shouldice appears to be the superior technique in terms of lower recurrence rate, ease of application, and patient satisfaction. This could be because the Shouldice technique is more economical and less invasive than the Bassini or Cooper's ligament repair. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the relative effectiveness of Shouldice and of any other technique in comparison to no more than one technique in terms of lower recurrence rate, ease of application, and patient satisfaction."
CD001691,"There is evidence that the anti- hemorrhagic measures taken in the initial hospital stay and in the following days reduce the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants. However, there is no evidence that the anti-hemorrhage measures taken in the initial hospital stay and in the following days reduce the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. These data do not support the continued use of anti-hemorrhage measures in the initial hospital stay and in the following days."
CD001694,"There is evidence that furosemide improves pulmonary mechanics in ventilated infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, there is no evidence that the effects of furosemide on pulmonary mechanics last longer than 2 hours."
CD001705,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of compression for displaced fractures of the neck of the femur. In the absence of evidence from other studies, compression should be used in all cases of displaced neck fracture."
CD001715,"There is no evidence of effect of sertindole in patients with schizophrenia. In the absence of evidence of benefit of sertindole in patients with schizophrenia, clinicians should recommend other antipsychotic medications."
CD001782,There is evidence that topical acids are effective for the treatment of perioral wrinkles. The results of this review confirm that topical acids are effective for the treatment of perioral wrinkles.
CD001815,There is some indication that oral erythromycin may be effective for promotion of enteral feeding in preterm infants with feeding intolerance. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of oral erythromycin in preterm infants.
CD001831,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of antitussive drug for the treatment of cough.
CD001874,There is evidence that bupivacaine infiltration reduces pain following tonsillectomy. This finding is not significant for other outcomes such as postoperative nausea and vomiting. There is no evidence that the block reduces analgesia after uvulopalatoplasty.
CD001878,There is no evidence to suggest that spinal manipulation is effective for the treatment of tension headaches. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001896,There is evidence that LPSN is effective for treating primary dysmenorrhea. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.
CD001900,"remacemide hydrochloride may be as effective as Tegretol as an antiepileptic drug. However, the effects on plasma CBZ concentration and the appropriate reduction of CBZ dose by an unblinded observer are not clear. In patients with refractory epilepsy where REM is added to their existing treatment regimen, plasma CBZ concentration and the appropriate reduction of CBZ dose by an unblinded observer are likely to be significant underneath the benefit of REM. This could be because of the small number of participants in the trials and the small number of participants in the add-on trials. The effectiveness of"
CD001939,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific amino acids for treatment of latent portosystemic encephalopathy. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001943,"Oral loxapine appears to be an effective treatment for acute schizophrenia. In patients with psychosis where daily doses of 60 to 90 mg are advisable, a comparison of choice between oral loxapine and the antipsychotic drugs perphenazine and haloperidol was inconclusive. Based on the current evidence, it is not possible to recommend any specific drug for treatment of acute schizophrenia."
CD001946,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness of propranolol as a primary treatment for akathisia.
CD001983,"Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is a major cause of bone loss in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. The risk of vertebral fracture is increased with high doses of corticosteroid. Consequently, these patients are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Salmon calcitonin appears to be effective in preventing temporal arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. However, there is no evidence of effectiveness in preventing osteoporosis. In patients with chronic pain, corticosteroids are associated with a greater loss of bone. Therefore, these patients are at increased risk of developing"
CD001984,There is evidence that the ASES-S is a valid measure of treatment effects in people with fibromyalgia. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD001998,There is evidence that inpatients with symptomatic placenta previa are less likely to experience hospitalisation and less likely to experience bleeding during pregnancy. This finding may explain why there is limited evidence for inpatient versus outpatient expectant management in the situation described. There is no evidence that the cost of inpatient versus outpatient management of symptomatic placenta previa is higher in women who are treated in hospital.
CD002008,There is evidence that nutritional intervention can improve the nutritional status of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when used in conjunction with other interventions such as psychosocial support and dietary supplements.
CD002009,"There is evidence that tobramycin is effective in treating acute exacerbations of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis. In a review of randomized controlled trials including 42 patients, significant improvement was seen in the rate of improvement for all outcomes. The results suggest that tobramycin is effective in treating acute exacerbations of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis."
CD002037,"induction therapy of four drugs per arm is effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection in infected people with moderately severe HIV infection. However, it is not clear that this strategy is effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection in infected people with moderately severe HIV infection. Maintenance therapy of four drugs per arm is effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection in infected people with moderately severe HIV infection. However, it is not clear that this strategy is effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection in infected people with moderately severe HIV infection."
CD002047,"Cascade and leflunomide are highly effective in the treatment of RA. Both active treatments improved signs and symptoms of active RA, delayed disease progression as demonstrated by x-ray films, and improved function and health-related quality of life. No unexpected or serious adverse drug effects were identified in the combination group during the 12-month period. The risk of end-of-trial complications is low in both active and COMB therapy."
CD002053,"Oral clonidine appears to be a safe adjunct to oral opium for treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome. In comparisons with placebo, clonidine appeared to be more effective in terms of lower treatment failure and shorter hospital stay than either opiate alone. However, there was no evidence regarding the long-term safety of clonidine. In comparisons with other adjuncts, clonidine appeared to be more effective in terms of lower treatment failure and shorter hospital stay than either opiate alone."
CD002055,"There is evidence that FFP may be beneficial for preterm infants with hypotension. However, the data on renal function in preterm infants is limited due to the small number of infants studied and the small number of participants in each study. Further studies are needed to determine if FFP is beneficial for preterm infants and if so, how many infants are receiving FFP and the frequency of the infusion."
CD002068,"No evidence is available using oral pamidronate for the treatment of pain in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. In the absence of evidence from other metastatic cancer treatments, oral pamidronate appears to be an effective treatment for pain in these patients. The beneficial effects appear to be dose-dependent. Patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer should be offered oral pamidronate at the start of treatment."
CD002073,There is evidence that endoscopic laser surgery is more effective than serial amnioreduction for the treatment of severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD002085,"No-show rates for first-time appointments at psychiatric out-patient clinics are significantly reduced when people are given a notice of the appointment or when they are offered a choice of email or phone prompt. However, there is no evidence that this effect is effective for large numbers of people. There is no evidence that this effect is effective for small numbers of people."
CD002095,There is evidence that proton pump inhibitors are effective for the treatment of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. The evidence is not conclusive however. In one trial the evidence was statistically significant. In another trial the evidence was not significant. Until further evidence is established proton pump inhibitors are more effective than placebo in the treatment of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux.
CD002113,There is evidence that exercise and incontinence care can reduce the incidence of selected acute conditions in homebound older adults. This finding is not corroborated by evidence from other studies. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of exercise and incontinence care in order to determine whether the benefits seen in studies of this type are attributable to randomised trials or to changes in practice.
CD002122,There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of progestogen only preparations in the treatment of pain symptoms after endometriosis. Women with endometriosis who are not wishing to carry on with contraceptive treatment may be candidates for progestogen only preparations.
CD002139,"Postoperative chemotherapy is effective in reducing mortality and prolonging disease-free survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It is more effective than chemotherapy alone in reducing tumour size but there is no evidence of a significant effect on overall survival. In patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer where chemotherapy is not effective, adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered with caution."
CD002179,"oxatomide is an orally active H1-histamine receptor antagonist. It has been demonstrated to have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of allergic diseases in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxatomide in the treatment of asthma in children. Sixty-four asthmatic children of both sexes, aged between 5 and 16 years, were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a duration of 4 months. Patients were randomized chosen to receive either oxatomide with a daily dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg body weight or a placebo twice daily. Clinical evaluations including pulmonary"
CD002200,There is evidence that colonoscopy is effective for early detection of colon cancer. There is no evidence that colonoscopy is effective for early recurrence or that it is effective for preventing the recurrence of colon cancer.
CD002208,"There is evidence that methadone maintenance treatment is more effective than buprenorphine in reducing opioid use and maintaining patients in treatment for 25 weeks. However, there is no evidence that this treatment is more effective than naltrexone in preventing opioid use. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of different types in order to determine the effectiveness of different types of treatment in preventing opioid use."
CD002214,"There is evidence that different care settings can produce different outcomes for the critically ill. In the case of special care unit care, the findings show significant savings in the costs of delivering care. In the case of ICU care, the findings show significant cost savings. In the case of SCU, the findings show significant savings in the charges accrued during the study period and in the charges and costs to produce a survivor."
CD002217,We found no clear evidence to support the use of any specific type of antiepileptic drug for treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy. The use of any specific type of antiepileptic drug for treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy is controversial. Recent studies have shown that most newly diagnosed epileptic patients can be satisfactorily treated with a single antiepileptic drug. The use of any specific type of antiepileptic drug for treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy is controversial.
CD002224,"There is evidence that radiation is superior to no treatment or dissection in the treatment of carcinoma of the vulva in women with early stage cancer. This evidence is corroborated by high mortality from vulva cancer, and by evidence that groin radiation is less harmful than no treatment or dissection. The evidence of superior radiation to no treatment or dissection in women with early stage vulva cancer is corroborated by evidence that"
CD002230,"There is evidence that oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors can increase exercise duration, peak VO2, and quality of life in patients with heart failure. The results of this review are limited due to the small number of patients included in the trials and the small number of participants. Adverse events appear to be similar to placebo or a placebo-controlled trial. Adverse events other than death were slightly, but not significantly, higher with enoximone (32%) than with placebo (22%). During therapy, five deaths occurred in the enoximone group, and none occurred in the placebo group (p less than 0.05)."

CD002265,"CYP deletase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of acute, severe NPSLE. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in the treatment of chronic NPSLE. Cyclophosphamide appears to be the superior treatment for acute, severe NPSLE. However, there is no evidence to recommend its use in the treatment of chronic NPSLE. methylprednisolone (MP) may be more effective than cyclophosphamide for acute, severe NPSLE. However, there is no evidence to recommend its use in the treatment of chronic NPSLE."
CD002271,There is evidence that continuous positive airway pressure therapy may be effective in reducing the frequency of up-transfer of infants with respiratory distress from non-tertiary care to non-tertiary care. There is evidence that the use of CPH in non-tertiary care may reduce the risk of pneumothorax.
CD002277,intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an investigational therapy for treating myasthenia gravis. There is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials. One trial found significant improvement in the rate of improvement in patients with myasthenia gravis after receiving 2 g/kg of IVIG for 2 consecutive days. The trial results suggest that the optimal dose of IVIG for treating myasthenia gravis is 2 g/kg for 2 consecutive days. This is based on medium-term evidence. There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials comparing treatments for myasthenia gravis.
CD002280,"Topical fluoride may be beneficial for children's dental health. However, there is insufficient evidence from this study to support or refute the use of topical fluoride in fluoridated water. Where possible, children should be offered a choice of non-fatal or topical fluoride products."
CD002282,"There is evidence that the use of a GIC for orthodontic bonding is associated with a higher frequency of bracket failure, time required for the clean-up of enamel surfaces and a smaller percentage of bracket failure than the use of a diacrylate bonding material. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of bonding materials."
CD002752,There is evidence that different interventions can be used in different patients with heart failure to produce different outcomes. One trial showed that a four-session intervention led by a community pharmacist can reduce the frequency of hospital admissions and mortality in patients with heart failure. Another trial showed that a four-session intervention led by a community pharmacist can reduce the number of hospital admissions and mortality in patients with heart failure. These results apply to patients with heart failure in the US or in other countries.
CD002760,ibuprofen is an effective analgesic for treating post-operative dental pain.

CD002783,"There is no evidence of effectiveness or safety of tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis. In the event of a DVT, the recommended treatment is rt-PA alone, followed by heparin-free treatment. The risk of bleeding is unchanged in all groups."
CD002784,"There is evidence that intraarterial thrombolysis is effective in the treatment of acute peripheral arterial occlusion. In patients with acute ischaemia of the legs, thrombolysis is associated with a lower incidence of hospitalisation and mortality than catheter-directed urokinase therapy. However, most of the studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed."
CD002786,A single dose of aspirin is effective for prevention of systemic thrombosis in patients on hemodialysis. The beneficial effects of aspirin on venous thrombosis are limited due to the high attrition bias. A single dose of aspirin is effective for prevention of systemic thrombosis in patients on hemodialysis.
CD002815,There is evidence that physical therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease can improve the quality of life of patients with the disease. The evidence is not conclusive because data were not reported on the use of external sensory cues.
CD002828,There is no evidence of benefit from anticholinesterase therapy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. The evidence of improvement is limited due to the small number of patients studied and the lack of detailed outcome data. It is only with the assistance of large randomized controlled trials that improvements can be attributed.
CD002855,There is evidence that the vaginal route of misoprostol is more effective than the oral route when used in women seeking early abortion. This finding is based on a single trial that identified six women who had abortions after receiving two doses of vaginal misoprostol. The results suggest that the buccal route of misoprostol is more effective than the oral route when used in women seeking early abortion.
CD002869,There is some indication that a maternal role preparation program may be beneficial for women wishing to attempt a vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD002873,"There is evidence that salbutamol alone improves clinical status and lung function in infants with recurrent wheeze when used in combination with salbutamol-S. However, there is no evidence that this effect applies to non-institutionalised infants. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes.

CD002896,There is evidence that intermittent left vagus nerve stimulation may be effective for suppressing partial-onset seizures in people with epilepsy. The effectiveness and safety of high-intensity stimulation is more equivocal than low-intensity stimulation. This is because both stimulation methods are equally effective and because both stimulation methods are equally safe. Long-term data are required to determine the effectiveness and safety of high-intensity stimulation and of low-intensity stimulation.
CD002911,No studies have compared desmopressin with other treatments such as enuresis alarm or with other conditioning methods such as bell and pad. There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of drug for treatment of nocturnal enuresis.

CD002982,There is some indication that exercise may have some small therapeutic effects on asthma. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm this.
CD002987,"There is no evidence that the addition of TAO to methylprednisolone reduces pulmonary function oratory volume in children with asthma. In addition, the reductions in methylprednisolone dose were not significantly different between treatment groups. Differences were also observed between the two treatment groups in serum IgG, fasting blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and progression of osteoporosis. In each instance the more unfavorable response occurred in those subjects receiving TAO. Lack of statistically significant changes in the efficacy parameters were likely a result of small sample size and effects of the glucocorticoid dose taper. TAO is safe and may"
CD002988,"Salbutamol when given in both inhaled and nebulised doses is an effective treatment for severe acute asthma. However, there is no evidence of effectiveness when used intubated. Theophylline (3-6 mg.kg-1) when infused i.v. 60 min after the start of salbutamol treatment is associated with a significant increase in PEF. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment in patients with severe acute asthma."

CD003051,There is evidence that topical fibrin glue may be effective for reducing air leakage following pulmonary resection. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD003054,There is evidence that lifestyle interventions can reduce the risk of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. This finding is consistent with the findings of the first two studies and suggests that lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing the risk of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.
CD003071,"There is evidence that different analgesics provide different outcomes in different patients following knee replacement surgery. In the absence of evidence from other studies, this review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest analgesia available."
CD003075,"The benefits of ACE inhibitors have been firmly established in studies of patients with mild to moderate hypertension. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with concomitant hypertension.

Further high quality, fully powered studies are needed to determine if ACE inhibitors have a beneficial effect on outcomes in patients with concomitant hypertension."
CD003082,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of haloperidol as a primary antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia where available evidence is not adequate, haloperidol may be considered as a primary antipsychotic treatment. Patients with schizophrenia who are not eligible for other antipsychotic treatments must be offered access to haloperidol. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention-to-treat analysis to allow better external validity."
CD003096,"There is evidence that women with preterm uterine contractions are more likely to be discharged from hospital than women with non- preterm uterine contractions. However, the data on outcomes are sparse. This may explain why there is limited evidence for a role for non-opioid drugs in the treatment of women with preterm uterine contractions."
CD003120,"There is evidence that ginkgo biloba extract may be beneficial for people with mild to moderate dementia.

Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of estrogen replacement therapy compared to placebo or other hormonal treatments in improving working memory in older men and women."
CD003123,There is evidence that adrenaline may be effective for children with acute bronchiolitis. The evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of adrenaline in children with bronchiolitis.
CD003139,"There is evidence that high-dose chemotherapy may be beneficial for patients with primary breast cancer with axillary lymph node involvement. However, there is no evidence that this benefit is statistically significant. There is evidence that high-dose chemotherapy may be associated with more toxicity and a higher rate of adverse outcomes than chemotherapy with no support from haemopoietic progenitor-cell support. However, there is no evidence that this benefit is statistically significant."
CD003147,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of physiotherapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

CD003212,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of non-invasive, intermittent positive pressure ventilation (nSIMV) as a mode of extubation in preterm infants. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods of ventilation, the review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest form of ventilation. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of nSIMV in the early intervention of RDS and in the initial care of infants in NICU."
CD003219,"Cognitive therapy, antidepressants and antiseptics are effective treatments for CTS. Surprisingly, there is no evidence for the use of antiseptics in the treatment of CTS.

There is no evidence for the use of any new therapies in the treatment of CTS."
CD003225,There is no evidence of efficacy or effectiveness of non-selective beta blockers in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. One trial found significant side effects when using propranolol compared to placebo. Another trial found significant adverse effects when using propranolol compared to metoprolol. The evidence of efficacy and effectiveness of non-selective beta blockers in the prophylactic treatment of migraine is inconclusive.
CD003231,"Corticosteroids are effective in treating superficial bladder cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs in patients with CIS. The best evidence comes from a multicenter randomized trial of mitomycin versus BCG-Tice, andBCG-Rivm. These trials were conducted in the Netherlands. No significant differences were found in response rate or disease-free interval in patients with CIS. However, there was a 10% and 5% increase in the risk of metastasis and death respectively. The effectiveness of corticosteroids is unknown in patients with CIS."
CD003243,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in the treatment of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Patients with chronic reflux disease are more satisfied with LNF compared to proton-pump inhibitor therapy, but the results are not statistically significant.

There is evidence that quinine is more effective than other antimalarial drugs."
CD003351,"There is evidence that ketamine enhances the analgesic effect of morphine, thus reducing the dose of intrathecal morphine. This finding is consistent with previous studies. It is not clear that the effects of ketamine on morphine analgesia are equally effective as those of epidural and intrathecally morphine. The effectiveness of ketamine on morphine appears to be similar to or possibly superior to that of epidural and intrathecally morphine. This finding is consistent with previous studies."
CD003385,There is evidence that psychotherapy can improve symptoms of bulimia nervosa. This is based on randomised controlled trials in which patients are given either fluoxetine or placebo for a period of 35 days. There is no evidence that the improvement seen in the trials is maintained. The data are too sparse to make specific recommendations for the first line treatment of bulimia nervosa.
CD003412,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of Mohs' micrographic therapy in the treatment of superficial basal-cell carcinoma.

The review identified six new studies that should be undertaken in the next few years."
CD003427,There is evidence that continued penicillin prophylaxis is effective in preventing reimmunization of children with anemia from being exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae. This information does not exclude the possibility that reimmunization may lead to the infection of other children with anemia. These results do not support the continued use of penicillin prophylaxis in children with anemia.
CD003458,There is evidence that a lower dose of sucrose (37 g) administered in a more convenient manner than a higher dose (75 g) is effective for improving exercise capacity in patients with McArdle disease. This review underlines the urgent need for more evidence in this field.
CD003467,"The NMDA receptor antagonists amantadine and amantadine seem to have some small clinically and statistically significant effects on L-dopa-induced dyskinesias. These results do not support the use of oral L-dopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, it is clear that the L-dopa-induced dyskinesias can be improved with the use of oral L-dopa. These results do not support the use of oral levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease."

CD003838,"Withdrawal of long-term diuretic medication in elderly patients: a double blind randomised trial. About 20% of elderly people use long-term diuretic medication, but there is doubt whether prolonged diuretic medication on such a large scale is necessary. We found that in most patients with chronic heart failure withdrawal causes a increase in blood pressure and symptoms of heart failure. This may explain why so few people have been successful in withdrawing long-term diuretic therapy."

The evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures."
CD003940,"Creams, tablets and capsules are effective in the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. One study found significant side effects when tablets or capsules are given in either glucose or fat emulsion. Another found significant side effects when tablets or capsules are given in either glucose or fat emulsion. The effectiveness and effectiveness of oral hygiene products in the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis is inconclusive due to the small number of participants in the studies."
CD003948,"There is no high quality evidence that metronidazole is superior to placebo in treating odour-free tumours. In view of the low occurrence of skin reactions and the ease of administration, metronidazole appears to be an effective palliative treatment for fungating tumours. Readers of the first review should re-read the document in full."
CD003954,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that diazepam may be beneficial for the prevention of tetanus in children. However, the data are not conclusive and further research is needed."
CD003978,"There is no evidence of metabolic efficiency or cost savings for prosthetic feet worn by transtibial amputees. Differences in the timing of early stance events such as peak shank velocity, peak ankle plantarflexion and peak knee flexion are associated with poorer metabolic rate and efficiency. Future prosthetic designs should attempt to capture the dynamic characteristics of a normal articulation between the foot and shank segments during the early stance weight acceptance period."
CD004020,"There is evidence that a lateral wedged insole with subtalar strapping is effective for reducing load in patients with medial or lateral compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. The results suggest that a brace intended to reduce load is effective in the short term in reducing pain in patients with OA. However, many patients do not adhere in the long run to this kind of conservative treatment."
CD004074,"We found no evidence that the method of cord clamping used in Zambia reduces the risk of early anaemia, in particular in term infants, or that it reduces the risk of active labour or that newborns experience any adverse effects. The method of cord clamping used in Zambia may be useful in reducing the risk of early anaemia, in particular in term infants. However, it should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD004081,"There is evidence that the use of lidocaine for inflate the endotracheal tube cuffs reduces the incidence of postoperative sore throat and may reduce the frequency of cough. However, there is no evidence that the use of lidocaine for inflate the ETCuffs reduces the frequency of sore throat. The available evidence is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of lidocaine for inflate the endotracheal tube cuffs in post-operative care."
CD004115,There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of topical medication for retention enemas in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.
CD004127,"Early weaning of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reduces the duration of daily support, length of RICU stay and mortality. However, most patients in the NIV group developed complications related to ETMV and/or the weaning process, but the difference was not significant (nine of 16 versus six of 17). The two weaning groups were similar for type of chronic respiratory failure (CRF), pulmonary function data, age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and severity of ACRF on admission."
CD004128,Implications for practice There is evidence that mild hypothermia may improve the prognosis of people who are in cardiac arrest outside the hospital.
CD004136,The benefits of ACE inhibitors for preventing and delaying the onset of microalbuminuria are unclear at this time. There is no evidence that the effects of ACE inhibitors are protective in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
CD004170,There is evidence that rehabilitation offered in the home is effective in improving the quality of life of people with severe traumatic head injury. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of intervention. Further studies are needed to determine whether the gains seen in the home are transient or if there is a need for more intervention.
CD004181,"There is evidence that ISG is effective for preventing the spread of HAV in adults. It is unclear whether the effectiveness of ISG is affected by the small number of participants in each study or the small sample size. The risk of hepatitis A infection after exposure to ISG is low. In areas where HAV is circulating, ISG may be effective for preventing the disease at a lower rate than routine immunoglobulin prophylaxis. In areas where HAV is circulating, ISG may be effective for preventing the disease at a lower rate than routine immunoglobulin prophylaxis. The risk of hepatitis A"
CD004185,"There is no evidence of effect or effectiveness of milnacipran in the treatment of major depressive disorder. When used in the treatment of anxiety, it may be more effective than fluoxetine. When used in the treatment of major depressive disorder, it may be more effective than amitriptyline. These results apply to outpatients with major depressive disorder and are not applicable to patients with mild to moderate depression."
CD004194,"Atenolol appears to be ineffective for preventing the recurrence of neurocardiogenic syncope in patients with recurrent syncope. This finding is based on a single trial and does not exclude the possibility that the drug is effective in preventing other symptoms of syncope such as fidgeting, vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no evidence that the drug is effective in preventing other symptoms of syncope such as fidgeting, vomiting and diarrhea. The availability of more effective atenolol treatments is at present unclear."
CD004198,There is no evidence of benefit of SSRIs in preventing stuttering attacks. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of SSRIs in preventing attacks of priapism.
CD004207,"There is evidence that SnMP may be effective for controlling hyperbilirubinemia in term and near-term newborns. In addition, it may be effective in preventing the use of PT in these infants. In conclusion, there is evidence that SnMP may be effective for controlling hyperbilirubinemia in term and near-term newborns. In addition, it may be effective in preventing the use of PT in these infants."
CD004214,Early weaning from the incubator to an open crib appears to be safe and effective for moderately preterm infants. This is based on medium-term evidence. No infants required transfer back to the incubator. Only one infant was readmitted to the hospital during the first week after discharge. Growth velocities and individual amounts of breastfeeding were similar between the 2 groups.
CD004217,There is evidence that a well-designed study of appropriate size and rigour is needed to determine the effectiveness of analgesia for pain management during circumcision.
CD004219,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of percutaneous central venous catheters in preterm infants. In comparisons with other lines of IV therapy, there was no significant difference in the incidence of sepsis, number of insertion attempts or catheters required for total intravenous therapy, or in the duration of intravenous use. The evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of peripheral intravenous catheters in preterm infants is inconclusive."
CD004277,"There is evidence that cyclosporine may be an effective therapy for patients with severe ulcerative colitis. In an uncontrolled study, 80 percent of 32 patients with active ulcerative colitis refractory to corticosteroid therapy had a response to cyclosporine therapy."
CD004317,The few studies included in the review did not allow conclusions about the effect of phone calls from reproductive health professionals on contraceptive use. It is not clear that phone calls from reproductive health professionals are effective in increasing contraceptive use.
CD004362,Rising tides of evidence have eroded the previous evidence base on the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment of acute mania. Studies identifying the most effective and effective antipsychotic treatment are needed.
CD004366,There is evidence that exercise can reduce depressive symptoms in a significant number of people. This finding does not exclude the possibility that exercise may be a treatment choice for people with depression.
CD004376,There is evidence that exercise can improve functional status and pain in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis without increasing the risk of medication use. This finding is based on medium-term evidence from two randomized controlled trials.
CD004381,The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of a musical presentation of social story information on the behaviors of students with autism. Social stories are a means of incorporating an individual with autism's propensity toward visual learning with educationally necessary behavior modifications. We found four studies that showed a small reduction in target behavior when a musical version of the social story was presented to students with autism. These studies confirm the need for more studies of high methodological rigour in order to define the effectiveness of musical adaptations of social stories in modifying behaviors of students with autism.
CD004409,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of hostel wards in alleviating the burden of long-term care. When used as a form of care for new patients arriving at the district general hospital, they may have some benefits that cannot be ignored. However, these benefits should be interpreted with caution because of the high attrition bias, the small number of patients and the small number of studies included in the review. Further studies are needed to determine whether the benefits of a hostel ward in alleviating long-term care are worthwhile."
CD004425,"Marvelon and Diane appear to be similar in effectiveness in the treatment of acne. No significant differences were found in the rate of effectiveness of either preparation in women with acne. One trial found a significant decrease in the rate of acne after use of Diane, although there was no evidence of a difference in the rate of acne after use of either preparation."
CD004447,"Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that GH secretion is effective in patients with hypophosphatemia. Growth hormone may be as effective as vitamin D therapy in treating rickets. However, long term data on the effectiveness of GH in treating rickets is lacking."
CD004481,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of colchicine in the treatment of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The drug appears to be effective in reducing levels of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase, which are important markers of liver disease. However, there is no evidence of a reduction in the severity of symptoms or physical findings in the patients treated with colchicine. This could be because the drug is not effective in reducing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis."
CD004487,"There is evidence that acetaminophen can provide some relief in postoperative dental pain. In a review of randomized controlled trials including 42 studies, moderate quality evidence suggests that the analgesic effects of acetaminophen are not significantly different from acetaminophen in combination with codeine. The analgesic effects of each active medication was significant by hour 1 and persisted for 5-6 hours."
CD004495,There is evidence that cefpazidime may be a useful first-line antibiotic in the treatment of early and late neonatal infections. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of antibiotic regimen. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for this type of patient.
CD004504,There is no evidence of effect or effectiveness of topical massage with Rado-Salil in the treatment of acute mechanical low-back pain. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD004538,"There is evidence that information about the quality of life of a hospital's patients is a useful tool for improving the quality of care. However, there is no evidence that information about the quality of life of a hospital's patients is effective in improving the quality of care."
CD004571,"There is no evidence of effect of calcium antagonists in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One trial showed a significant reduction in the number of muscle fibres in the treated patients, but not in the placebo group. Another trial showed a significant reduction in the muscular X-ray density under treatment. No evidence was found of effect of calcium antagonists in treating children with early onset muscular dystrophy."
CD004572,No evidence is available using aldose reductase inhibitors to manage the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. There is limited evidence that aldose reductase inhibitors are effective for treating peripheral neuropathy. There is no evidence that aldose reductase inhibitors are effective for managing the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.
CD004585,"There is some indication that biofeedback may be useful for the remobilization of stroke patients. The results of this review are limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies and the lack of standardisation in the choice of the method of therapy. However, it seems desirable to carry out large randomised trials in which patients are given choice of two therapies."
CD004604,There is no evidence that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors provide superior pain relief than placebo in patients with acute pain after third molar surgery. There is limited evidence that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors provide superior pain relief than placebo in patients with acute pain after third molar surgery.
CD004611,Saccharomyces boulardii can be treated with either a single dose or a double dose of oral antibiotics. The beneficial effects of Saccharomyces boulardii are limited to patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile disease. Its efficacy in reducing recurrence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease is not clear in patients with a history of active CDD.
CD004668,"We found a diversity of approaches in treatment of FE. Surprisingly, behavioural therapy was more effective than pharmacological therapy in improving FE-related outcomes. This may be because the children were more likely to respond to the bells and alarms, and the bells and alarms provide a more convenient way of controlling enuresis. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform randomised trials on different outcomes."
CD004678,"There is evidence that Cop 1 may be beneficial in patients with the exacerbating-remitting form of multiple sclerosis. However, this is a preliminary result and further research is needed."
CD004685,"Treatment of tinea capitis caused by Microsporum canis, Trichophyton or Microsporum species is effective in most patients. However, the duration of treatment is unclear. In the Microsporum group only one of seven patients treated for 1 week and none of five treated for 2 weeks responded. However, treatment was effective in four of six (66%) patients treated for an additional 4 weeks. Mild to moderate adverse events believed to be drug related occurred in four patients in each of the two groups. Terbinafine is well tolerated, and requires 2 weeks of treatment in most patients with Tr"
CD004735,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in the situation described.
CD004737,"There is evidence that the method of placental removal performed in women undergoing cesarean delivery is associated with a reduction in post-operative infections, and a decrease in the incidence of endometritis. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures."
CD004740,There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in the treatment of acute otitis externa. Patients with acute otitis externa were more likely to be cured when treated with topical corticosteroids compared to non- corticosteroids.
CD004746,"Galantamine appears to be effective for improving cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease plus cerebrovascular disease (AD + CVD). However, improvement in activities of daily living with galantamine was similar to that observed with placebo. The results of this review indicate that galantamine is effective for long-term maintenance of the cognitive function in patients with AD + CVD and is safe and well tolerated in this patient population."
CD004751,"There is inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of laparoscopy in the management of benign ovarian masses. Inclusion criteria was tumor not suspected to be malignant with a diameter of < or = 10 cm as measured by ultrasonography. All operations were performed by trainees under the supervision of an experienced surgeon. The laparoscopic approach was associated with a significant reduction in operative morbidity (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.88), postoperative pain and analgesic requirement, hospital stay, and recovery period. Patients in general were satisfied with the operation, but significantly more patients were"
CD004787,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with standard chemotherapy, either in the initial phase or later in life, either regimens are associated with a lower mortality rate than control or no treatment. The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated with standard chemotherapy, either in the initial phase or later in life, the regimens are associated with a lower mortality rate than control or no treatment."
CD004791,"The benefits of ciprofloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are clear from the small studies. It reduces the risk of serious adverse effects on patients, but it does not reduce the risk of death. In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, ciprofloxacin appears to be more effective than weekly rufloxacin in preventing peritonitis recurrence. This could be because the bacteria are more easily identifiable when soluble in the fluid. Further large studies are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of ciproflox"
CD004829,There is evidence that some opioid medications are effective for intraoperative pain. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct randomized controlled trials of new opioid medications in settings where patient-controlled analgesia is available.
CD004842,The two studies included in this review provide evidence that metamizol is an effective analgesic for acute migraine pain. One study identified a significant benefit for pain in the first dose of metamizol compared to placebo. The other study identified a significant benefit for pain in the second dose of metamizol compared to placebo. These results suggest that metamizol is an effective analgesic for acute migraine.
CD004873,There is evidence that chest physiotherapy may have short-term benefits for infants with acute bronchiolitis. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of CPT method.
CD004878,"There is evidence that oral dexamethasone may be beneficial for children with bronchiolitis when used in combination with nebulized salbutamol. However, this evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and lack of standardisation in the choice of drug used. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of oral dexamethasone and whether it should be offered to children with bronchiolitis in addition to nebulized salbutamol."
CD004884,"The use of antibiotics for the prevention of meningitis in patients with traumatic pneumocephalus is not new. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for the prevention of meningitis in patients with traumatic pneumocephalus. This is based on small studies in which risk of meningitis is unclear."
CD004888,The previous version of this review showed that ibc plus ribavirin was superior to interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-coinfected patients. This updated review provides evidence that the combination of ibc plus ribavirin is superior to interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-coinfected patients. This updated review provides evidence that the combination of ibc plus ribavirin is superior to interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in
CD004908,"There is evidence that aspirin can be effective for postpartum pain. In patients with uterine or episiotomy pain, there is a statistically significant analgesic response with aspirin when the pain intensity is more severe. However, this response is not alwaysicable and there may be reasons for caution in large studies of this type. In patients with severe episiotomy pain, aspirin-caffeine was more effective than 650 mg aspirin (p less than 0.05) at the second and third hours. There was no difference between analgesic effects of aspirin and aspirin-caffeine in women with severe uterine pain."
CD004918,"There is evidence that HAD implantation is an effective method of management of refractory glaucoma in spite of its unneligible complications. In view of the small number of eyes studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. One correction for typo in the first version of the review was required, as the previous version of the review provided insufficient evidence to support the use of single-plate HAD implantation."
CD004929,Early feeding in the postoperative hours is safe and effective and reduces the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients undergoing open colorectal surgery. This update provides further evidence to support the use of early feeding in the first few days after abdominal surgery.
CD004943,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of prophylaxis against aspiration pneumonitis in obstetric anesthesia. This review provides some evidence to show that omeprazole is more effective than ranitidine in preventing gastric aspirates. It should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD004950,There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with different infants to significantly manage pain response. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of intervention.
CD004957,There is evidence that different home care protocols can be used in different settings to produce different outcomes in different patient groups. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field.
CD004979,"There is evidence that oral amoxycillin is an effective antibiotic for severe pneumonia in children. In settings where amoxycillin is not available, the use of injectable penicillin may be more effective. This update does not cover the relative effectiveness of oral amoxycillin compared to injectable penicillin in treating severe pneumonia. Where possible, patients should be offered a choice of oral amoxycillin or parenteral penicillin. Short-term data suggest that the use of co-trimoxazole is more effective than amoxycillin in treatment of severe pneumonia in children."
CD004998,There is no evidence that muscle biofeedback or transcendental meditation is effective in the treatment of anxiety. There is limited evidence that relaxation therapy is effective in the treatment of chronic anxiety. There is no evidence that muscle biofeedback or transcendental meditation is effective in the treatment of anxiety.
CD005006,"There is evidence that doxorubicin is an effective first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. It may be advisable to prescribe this drug in addition to chemotherapy. In patients with metastatic breast cancer where chemotherapy is ineffective, doxorubicin may be considered in addition to chemotherapy. The risk of end-stage liver failure and congestive heart failure is significant in patients receiving doxorubicin in first-line therapy."
CD005009,"Intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) may be effective in reducing prostate cancer-related PSA levels in men with advanced prostate cancer. However, the long-term survival data on IAD patients is lacking. The data suggest that despite high serum PSA levels, prostate cancer may persist for longer than CAD treatment. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality in order to determine the effectiveness of IAD in reducing prostate cancer-related"
CD005042,"There is no evidence that psychostimulants are effective for children with ADHD. There is some evidence that the effects of psychostimulants are more potent than those of antidepressants. However, the data on psychostimulants in children with ADHD is sparse and any evidence of benefit or harm from psychostimulants in children with ADHD must be interpreted with caution."
CD005046,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of intrasphincteric botulinum toxin treatment for achalasia cardia. Patients with achalasia cardia can be offered choice of either pneumatic dilatation or botulinum toxin injection. The two treatment methods initially had equal success rates, but in the long term the effect of the botulinum toxin injection was statistically significantly shorter than that of balloon dilation. As fewer risks are associated with the injection treatment, studies should be undertaken either to identify patient subgroups in whom botulinum toxin can be effective long-term or to test"
CD005059,"There is evidence that postoperative analgesia may be beneficial for pain management in patients undergoing aortic surgery. However, there is no evidence that the use of postoperative analgesia is effective or not effective. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies used in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to determine whether postoperative analgesia is effective or not and, if so, which methods are best and which are most effective."
CD005081,CorticotROPIN IN TREATMENT OF OCULAR MYASTHENIA; A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL.
CD005083,There is no high quality evidence that honey increases the rate of healing of superficial burns. There is limited evidence that it reduces the incidence of hypertrophic scar and postburn contracture. There is no evidence that it reduces the incidence of infection.
CD005087,No evidence is available using amiloride as a treatment for lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. There is no evidence of benefit from amiloride in treating lung disease in people with severe CF. There is no evidence of benefit from amiloride in treating people with severe CF.
CD005102,There is evidence that exercise may reduce the risk of developing diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance. This finding is based on medium-term evidence from three randomized controlled trials.
CD005129,"Cumomegalovirus prophylaxis is effective in preventing primary infection of recipients of solid organ transplants. However, there is insufficient evidence for preventing secondary infection of these recipients. The use of oral acyclovir, in combination with immune globulin, appears to be ineffective. In the absence of evidence to support the use of oral acyclovir in preventing primary infection of recipients of solid organ transplants, we recommend the use of ganciclovir for this purpose."
CD005137,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of daily patching for amblyopia in children. In comparisons with spectacles, improvements in visual acuity were seen in the eyes of children with moderate to severe amblyopia. However, there was no significant improvement in the visual acuity of the eyes of children with severe amblyopia. This could be because the patching was done in a fixed dose and there was no way to know whether or not the effects of the patching were permanent."
CD005181,Interferon beta-1a appears to have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the time to progression of disease in people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence is available on the number of relapses or the rate of disability. There is no evidence on the quality of life or on MRI outcomes.
CD005190,We have not found evidence to support the use of any specific type of drug for treatment of acute alcoholic withdrawal.
CD005203,"There is evidence that an amino-acid-based formula may be beneficial for infants with severe cow's milk allergy/intolerance. In comparisons with eHF, there was a significant reduction in the percentage of surface area involved in the dermatitis. This could be because the formula contains fewer calories than eHF and therefore may be more effective in preventing the adverse effects of this diet. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal diet for infants with severe cow's milk allergy/intolerance."
CD005208,"There is evidence that abciximab may improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke when administered in a dose-escalated fashion. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of dose. However, it is clear that in a given population of patients, abciximab may improve outcomes. The beneficial effects of abciximab in treating acute ischemic stroke need to be evaluated in large scale studies along with safety."
CD005214,There is insufficient evidence to establish the relative effectiveness and effectiveness of two types of injectable contraceptives in different population groups. The choice of which to use is at the heart of the decision making process.
CD005237,"There is no evidence that divalproex has an advantage over other antipsychotic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia. In patients with early episode schizophrenia, divalproex appears to be equally effective as olanzapine. In patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, divalproex appears to be equally effective as olanzapine. These data do not support the use of any specific antipsychotic drug for treatment of acute exacerbation of schizophrenia."
CD005251,"There is some evidence that antibiotics can be used in the catheter catheterization of newborn infants, but it should be interpreted with caution."
CD005262,There is no evidence of effectiveness in the treatment of intermittent claudication with drugs. The most effective treatment is probably pentoxifylline. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD005276,"There is inconclusive evidence for the use of topical tetracaine as a local anesthetic in cataract surgery. When used in conjunction with other local anesthetic agents, the result can be described as a ""squarepeg"" result. There is no evidence for the use of lidocaine as a local anesthetic in the setting of phacoemulsification."
CD005331,"There is some indication that hypnosis may be effective for the treatment of conversion disorder. In a review of four studies including one that was underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between hypnosis and control groups, the authors found some evidence of improvement in the rate of conversion symptoms resolution and in the rate of anxiety. The review identified six studies that were underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between hypnosis and control groups and three studies that were underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between hypnosis and control groups. The conclusions of the review were:"
CD005365,"There is evidence that the use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters is effective for preventing infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways. This finding is based on evidence from two randomised controlled trials. The first trial identified a significant reduction in the risk of infection of the CSF pathways when catheters are impregnated with antibiotics. The second trial identified a significant reduction in the risk of infection of the CSF pathways when catheters areimpregnated with antibiotic-impregnated. These findings apply to catheters used in intra-abdominal, perioperative and lapar"
CD005373,"In the absence of evidence to support other interventions, inhaled salbutamol or beclomethasone appears to be ineffective for children with recurrent cough. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any effect on cough score when inhaled salbutamol or beclomethasone is given in the presence of a suspected AHR. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of inhaled salbutamol or beclomethasone."
CD005397,There is evidence that exercise may improve postural stability in patients with acute vestibular disturbance. This results from a multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size. The results suggest that vestibular adaptation exercises result in improved postural stability and in a diminished perception of dysequilibrium.
CD005413,"The addition of subcutaneous IL-2 and IFN-alpha to BCDT chemotherapy in a randomized phase II trial resulted in immune activation but did not improve response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma, and indeed may increase some treatment-related toxicity. The two studies were small and did not show a significant difference in terms of survival, quality of life or overall survival. This review does not cover the many trials that have been inconclusive due to the small number of participants and the small sizes of the trials."
CD005421,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any interventions for improving parent-child communications about sexuality. These evaluations should be undertaken with caution in settings where there are a large number of parents and children who are not involved in the decision making process.
CD005463,There is no evidence that the parenting program offered in the current version of the review is effective in improving the quality of life of parents who abuse their children. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD005486,There is some indication that the use of a silver-releasing dressing for the treatment of venous leg ulcers may be beneficial. This is based on small studies in which evidence is available.
CD005496,probiotics have some theoretical advantages over non- probiotics in preterm infants. One theory is that probiotics reduce the risk of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Another theory is that probiotics reduce the intestinal permeability which could be useful in preventing the harms of probiotics in preterm infants. There is no evidence that probiotics are effective in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis.
CD005506,The oral rehydration therapy offered in this review is ineffective in children with acute gastroenteritis who are not receiving intravenous hydration. It is possible that the therapy may be more effective in children with acute gastroenteritis who are not receiving oral rehydration. One possibility is that the therapy may be more effective in children with acute gastroenteritis who are not receiving intravenous hydration. This could be based on medium-term evidence.
CD005508,"Intermittent claudication may be improved with the use of anthypertensives. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antihypertensives in this situation. In patients with peripheral vascular disease the risk of death is higher. Consequently, the use of anthypertensives in this situation should be considered cautiously."
CD005514,"There is evidence that the nocturnal bite plate is effective for controlling bruxism. In a study of high methodological quality, the authors found no evidence of a significant effect of the nocturnal bite plate on outcomes such as sleep interruption or episode of bruxism. This review has not examined economic data."
CD005522,"Treatment of severe pain from osteoarthritis with slow-release tramadol or dihydrocodeine in combination with NSAID's: a randomised study comparing analgesia, antinociception and gastrointestinal effects. Opioids are increasingly used in the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain. The aim of this open-label, randomised, parallel group study was to compare analgesia and side-effects of two commonly used opioid analgesics, tramadol and dihydrocodeine, in long-acting formulations in 60 osteoarthritis patients with strong pain despite NSAID's.

CD005523,There is some indication that aquatic exercise may be effective for the management of pain in people with symptomatic osteoarthritis. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the outcome measures.
CD005538,There is evidence that different non-opioid drugs can be used with different concentrations and doses in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy or tonsillectomy. This information does not exclude the possibility that the drugs are equally effective in alleviating pain.
CD005539,There is evidence that exercise undertaken by nurses can reduce the frequency of dietician referrals and improve patient care. There is no evidence that exercise undertaken by nurses can reduce the frequency of infections or the number of food-related issues addressed in care. There is evidence that exercise undertaken by nurses can improve the quality of care.
CD005542,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of therapy for the treatment of type I and type II diabetic pregnant women. When used together, these regimens demonstrate a significant improvement in the rate of metabolic control in women with type I and type II diabetes. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the regimens in the era of antenatal steroid use and early insulin administration is indicated."
CD005562,"Cognitive stimulation therapy may be useful for people with mild to moderate dementia. The evidence is limited due to the small number of studies included in the review, the lack of detailed outcome measures, and the lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to carry out large randomised trials on cognitive stimulation in people with dementia."
CD005568,There is evidence that El-treated patients with acute cerebral infarction are more satisfied and more willing to continue with treatment. This finding is consistent with previous studies and suggests that the beneficial effects of El-treated patients are more robust and lasting than those given conventional treatment.
CD005582,"Herzoster treatment can be divided into four regimens: oral corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids only, oral corticosteroids only, or a combination of the two. The choice of whether to use oral corticosteroids is important because it reduces the risk of side effects and may be useful in preventing the Flare-up. However, each regimens is associated with different adverse outcomes and thus the data on overall effectiveness and safety of the regimens are not conclusive."
CD005609,"There is evidence that reporting medication errors is effective in reducing the frequency of patient-related complications and in improving the quality of care. However, there is no evidence that reporting errors is effective in reducing the frequency of patient-related complications and in improving the quality of care."
CD005616,There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of surgery for patients with de Quervain's disease of pregnancy and lactation. Treatment with cortisone injection or thumb spica splint is effective for most symptoms.
CD005646,The two studies included in this review provide evidence that it is possible to perform a double-blinded trial of high methodological rigour in order to establish the effectiveness of a two-stage treatment regimen for HIV-positive patients with previous hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX. The results suggest that it is possible to perform a double-blind trial of high methodological rigour in order to establish the effectiveness of a two-stage treatment regimen for HIV-positive patients with previous hypersensitivity to TMP-SMX.
CD005944,"There is evidence that vitamin A supplementation, especially vitamin A supplementation of the A plant, is beneficial for mothers and infants. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of vitamin A supplementation on infants and mothers, and the effectiveness of high dose vitamin A supplementation is unclear."
CD005950,There is evidence that imagery may be a useful adjunct to therapy in improving the function and use of the more affected limb in stroke patients. This evidence is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD005952,The few studies included in the review did not allow conclusions about the effect of physiotherapy on mobility in post-acute stroke survivors. One trial showed a significant improvement in gait speed when treated compared to controls. There was no significant difference in the rate of improvement in time taken to walk or ability to use a mobile phone.
CD005959,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific type of fixation for humeral shaft fractures. The technique used in this review is Russell-Taylor, a design that has a long history of use in trauma. It is not clear that there is a significant difference in the rate of healing or other outcomes between intramedullary nailing and compression plating. However, it is clear that the rate of non-union is significantly higher in the IMN group compared to the PLT group. This may explain why there is limited evidence to support or not support the use of any specific type of fixation for humeral"
CD006002,"No evidence is available using recombinant human interferon alpha 2c in patients with chronic hepatitis D. Patients with hepatitis D are more likely to relapse if treated with high doses of interferon. This is because the immune system is not equipped to handle the effects of interferon, and because there is no evidence that the effects of interferon are sustained. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality in order to define the effectiveness of recombinant human interferon-alpha 2c in patients with chronic hepatitis D."
CD006028,"The beneficial effects of urodilatin for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery are inconclusive due to the high placebo effect. It is unclear whether or not urodilatin reduces the risk of acute renal failure. In patients with acute renal failure, dopamine and furosemide are ineffective. Patients with acute renal failure are advised to continue with dopaminergic therapy."
CD006033,The two studies included in this review provide evidence that both oral contraceptives containing drospirenone are effective for maintaining bone mineral density in women with early menopausal symptoms. The two studies included in this review provide evidence that both oral contraceptives containing drospirenone are effective for maintaining bone mineral density in women with early menopausal symptoms.
CD006069,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between beractant and lucinactant for the prevention of RDS in preterm infants. The two products are similar in effectiveness and safety when used for the prevention and treatment of RDS. One product is more effective than the other in preventing RDS in preterm infants, but there is no evidence that the two products are equally effective for preventing RDS. The other product is more effective than the other but there is no evidence that the two products are equally effective for preventing RDS. Until further evidence is established, we recommend the use of any surfactant containing a"
CD006097,"Two studies show a significant benefit from natalizumab for patients with moderately severe Crohn's disease. One trial showed a significant benefit from natalizumab in the rate of response to treatment, while another showed a significant benefit from natalizumab in the rate of response to treatment. However, both studies were of low methodological quality and further research is needed."
CD006101,"There is evidence that salmeterol is an effective bronchodilator in the treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In comparisons with other bronchodilators, the long-term data show a significant advantage for salmeterol in terms of improvement in airways obstruction, but not for improvement in symptom control or need for rescue salbutamol. This review underlines the urgent need for more effective bronchodilator therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
CD006107,"There is no evidence that ultrasound-guided embryo transfer increases the rate of pregnancy or live birth in assisted conception. This outcome is at odds with the UKs National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommendations for fertility treatment (Fertility Assessment and Treatment for People with Fertility Problems. London, UK: RCOG Press, 2004, 112.) which used a meta-analysis of four smaller trials (range 362-800 patients, totalling 2051 embryo transfers) to conclude that ultrasound should be offered. We suggest that the current Cochrane review should be updated with data from our trial and recommend that consideration is given to accounting for heterogeneity between the included"
CD006122,There is evidence that different enteral nutrition regimens are effective in differentiating burn patients. The most effective enteral nutrition regimen appears to be the one providing the most calories. The other regimens appear to be the most effective in terms of reducing infectious infections and length of stay in burn patients.
CD006133,"There is evidence that combined oral contraceptives can reduce LDL and HDL cholesterol, and may have benefits on other important parameters of health. There is no evidence that the combined oral contraceptives can increase LDL and HDL cholesterol."
CD006161,There is evidence that supplementary oxygen administration is effective in improving the NPC oxygenation during childbirth. This finding is based on a small study of 45 women who were given oxygen administered through nasal cannula in three randomlyised controlled trials. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference in NPC oxygenation when oxygen is administered through nasal cannula in three randomlyised controlled trials.
CD006168,There is some indication that biofeedback may be effective for alleviating pain during labour and childbirth. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of assessment.
CD006170,"There is evidence that different pump designs can alter milk expression patterns in mothers. This could have implications for the quality of breastfeeding, the length of breastfeeding, and the satisfaction of mothers with their pump choices."
CD006193,The use of cement is considered as an important way to control perioperative blood loss in knee arthroplasty. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of cement for tibial fixation in total knee arthroplasty. This finding should be interpreted with caution until further evidence is established.
CD006194,There is inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of external fixation in improving upper extremity function and pain scores in patients with distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement. This is based on randomised controlled trials.

There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for the prevention of work-related injuries in the mining, quarry, or power sector."
CD006268,"There is evidence that low dose, non-opioid sedation using benzodiazepines and long-acting opiates can be effective for pain, discomfort and sedation during colonoscopy. The results suggest that patients are more comfortable and more willing to cooperate when receiving low dose, non-opioid sedation."
CD006283,There is some indication that facial neuromuscular re-education may be effective for improving facial symmetry in patients with Bell's palsy. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the assessment of facial symmetry.
CD006309,There is some indication that psychotherapy may be a useful treatment for postpartum depression in women who are experiencing depressive symptoms. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of treatment.
CD006332,"There is evidence that naloxone reduces opioid-induced intestinal hypomotility and delays the rate of gastric emptying. However, there is no evidence that this effect is reversible. The evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of detailed outcome information that could make comparisons difficult."
CD006355,There is no evidence of effect of topical nitroglycerin in reducing pain in patients with RCT of supraspinatus tendinopathy. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of topical nitroglycerin in reducing pain in patients with RCT of supraspinatus tendinopathy.
CD006373,Voice therapy may be useful for students with mild voice disorders who are aspiring to become teachers. This review underlines the urgent need for more research into the effectiveness of voice therapy in treating students with mild voice disorders.
CD006378,"Cognitive decline in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease is not significantly increased with the use of indomethacin. However, the risk of long-term adverse effects on participants' health is high. The beneficial effects of indomethacin must therefore be evaluated in caution. Short-term data are needed on the effectiveness and safety of indomethacin in treating people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
CD006385,There is inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of any interventions for TMJ closed lock. The most effective interventions are those that offer no intervention at all.
CD006386,"Overall, the results of this review demonstrated insufficient evidence to support a role for non-platinum chemotherapy in improving survival and event-free survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. This review also showed that the risk of death from non-platinum chemotherapy in advanced head and neck cancer is high, and that there is a risk of acute mucositis when used in conjunction with platinum chemotherapy."
CD006400,There is no evidence that a specific diet is effective for patients with RA. dietary changes may be beneficial for the disease if undertaken in small studies.
CD006403,"There is no evidence of effect of anthrax vaccine adsorbed on immuneogenicity, and further research is needed."
CD006432,There is evidence that progressive muscle atrophy can lead to a decline in muscle strength and function in the upper extremity. This could explain why progressive muscle atrophy is associated with a poorer quality of life and poorer quality of life in people with stroke. The evidence is not robust for people with mild to moderate stroke.
CD006447,There is evidence that hypnosis can be used as a form of distraction in children undergoing surgery. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of assessment.
CD006455,There is no evidence of effect of antioxidant therapy on the rate of progression of Huntington's disease. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of antioxidant therapy on the rate of motor decline in people with early Huntington's disease. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of antioxidant therapy on the rate of neuropathy in people with early Huntington's disease.
CD006469,There is no evidence that the combination of cisplatin with ifosfamide and ifosfamide plus a small dose of paclitaxel improves OS or PFS in patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer of the uterine cervix. This review underlines the urgent need for more evidence in this field.
CD006484,There is evidence that influenza vaccination is effective in inducing a protective immune response in children with cancer. The response is consistent with previous studies that showed a protective immune response to inactivated trivalent split influenza vaccine in children with cancer.
CD006505,There is evidence that the inactivated varicella vaccine is effective in preventing herpesvirus reactivation in children with leukemia. This finding is based on randomised controlled trials in which participants are given three doses of the vaccine. The data are not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the provision of secondary immunization in children with leukemia.
CD006533,"There is no evidence of effect of oral quetiapine fumarate in the treatment of major depressive disorder. In the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, oral quetiapine fumarate may be effective. In the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, oral quetiapine fumarate may be effective."
CD006616,"There is evidence that N-acetylcysteine may be beneficial for patients with acute liver failure when used as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. In a review of randomised controlled trials, the authors found no evidence that the drug improves survival or rate of transplantation in patients with acute liver failure when used as an antidote for acetaminophen."
CD006639,"There is evidence that zinc supplementation, especially in the form of daily buffered iron, reduces the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in children. However, there is no evidence that this effect is reversible. Further studies are needed to determine if this effect is reversible and if so, to determine the optimal dose of zinc to be given to children."
CD006655,There is no high quality evidence that laparotomy is superior to laparoscopy in the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer. There is a risk of infection in all groups of patients. The risk of death is similar in all groups of patients.
CD006660,"There is evidence that probiotics reduce bacterial infection rates after liver transplantation. However, there is no evidence that the rates of infection or death are reduced. The evidence is limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies and the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Until further evidence is established, probiotics should be restricted to individual patients."
CD006665,There is evidence that ascorbic acid may be effective for the treatment of tetanus. This is based on small studies in which mortality and morbidity were reduced.
CD006667,"There is evidence that certain types of mechanical ventilation can improve oxygenation and pulmonary function in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the data on mortality and rate of weaning from mechanical ventilation are not significant. This is because the data on mortality and rate of weaning are not significant in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome."
CD006715,"There is evidence that TEA reduces the incidence of early respiratory tract infections, length of ICU stay and mortality in patients undergoing CABG. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of analgesia. Adequately powered trials are needed to determine if CABG patients are more likely to experience early respiratory failure or stroke with the use of TEA."
CD006717,There is evidence that stretching and quadriceps exercises are effective in alleviating pain in people with patellofemoral pain. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the outcome measures. Further well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of each of the four quadriceps exercises in improving pain function in people with patellofemoral pain.
CD006726,There is some indication that trauma therapy may be an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in children and young people. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD006728,There is no high quality evidence that family therapy increases treatment response in depressed adolescents.
CD006734,"There is evidence that in the low-resource settings where breastfeeding is available, it is possible to achieve a significant improvement in the rate of HIV-free survival of children born to mothers infected with HIV. This is based on randomised controlled trials in developing countries. There is no evidence that the rate of HIV-free survival of children born to mothers infected with HIV is increased or decreased when they are not breastfeeding."
CD006746,"There is no evidence of benefit from laser peripheral iridotomy in the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma. In the absence of evidence from other trials, this review should be interpreted with caution."
CD006771,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of subcutaneous calcium heparin in the treatment of acute proximal thrombosis of the legs. In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis of the legs, calcium heparin appears to be more effective in lyse existing thrombus and preventing its propagation than intravenous sodium heparin."
CD006772,"There is some indication that the use of tailored care plans for patients with coronary heart disease is effective. Results from one trial suggest that there are modest reductions in the number of hospital admissions and cardiovascular events in the intervention group compared to the control group. This could be because the plans offer more information about the disease to allow better assessment, and because the plans offer a more convenient way of checking on patients. The effectiveness of tailored care plans for patients with coronary heart disease is unclear at this time."
CD006790,"Interferon-beta-1a may be effective in induction of remission in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis. However, most of the trials were of low methodological quality and small sample sizes. This may explain why there is limited evidence for a role for interferon-beta-1a in induction of remission in patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis. The beneficial effects of interferon-beta-1a appear to be modest compared to other anti-inflammatory drugs, but are effective in induction of remission."
CD006829,"COPD exacerbations are a common side-effect of treatment of moderate and severe COPD. Recent evidence suggests that salmeterol/fluticasone propionate may be effective in preventing exacerbations in patients with severe COPD. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of the drug. In patients with severe COPD, exacerbations are a major side-effect of treatment of salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. The risk of serious adverse events is low with both treatments. Consequently these data do not support the continued use of salmeterol alone in the treatment of exacerbations in"
CD006853,There is some indication that exercise may be beneficial for patients with RA. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of a long-term exercise program in patients with RA.
CD006866,"There is evidence that oral antiviral therapy can reduce the frequency and severity of chronic pain in patients with herpes zoster. In a meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that the rate of pain resolution and clinical outcomes in patients with herpes zoster is reduced with oral antiviral therapy."
CD006883,There is evidence that antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce blood loss during spinal surgery. One study showed that aprotinin reduced blood loss when used intra-operative. There is no evidence that aprotinin reduces the need for autologous blood transfusion. There is no evidence that aprotinin reduces the need for transfusion in patients undergoing spinal surgery.
CD006904,There is evidence that weaning mechanical ventilation support from patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery is effective in reducing the incidence of respiratory complications and length of hospitalisation. This is based on randomised controlled trials. No evidence was found that the weaning algorithm used in this review reduces the time to extubation or length of stay in patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery.
CD006907,"There is evidence that medication for moderate to severe hypertension reduces the risk of antenatal hospitalisation and serious perinatal complications in women with mild to severe hypertension. However, there is no evidence that medication for severe hypertension reduces the rate of preterm birth, neonatal intensive care or hospital admission or that women experience more complications from hypertension. These data do not support the continued use of medication for moderate to severe hypertension in women with mild to severe hypertension."
CD006943,There is no evidence of benefit of therapy for girls with covert bacteriuria of childhood. Results from one trial are inconclusive. Results from two trials are inconclusive.
CD006945,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of the use of urate oxidase in preventing tumor lysis syndrome in children with leukemia and lymphoma.
CD006956,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in improving postoperative quality of life. In patients with refractory Crohn's disease, laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection appears to be more effective than conventional surgery. The benefit of laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection may be more effective than conventional surgery in improving postoperative quality of life."
CD006963,There is evidence that the orientation of the condyles after vertical ramus osteotomy is different in patients with mandibular prognathism. This may explain why the relative stability of the condyles after vertical ramus osteotomy is different in patients with mandibular prognathism.
CD006972,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of initial L-thyroxine therapy in improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In severe CH, it is important to choose an initial dose at the higher end of the recommended range to achieve these goals. In moderate CH, it is important to choose an initial dose at the higher end of the recommended range to achieve these goals."
CD007024,"Discrepancies were seen between DIS and Naltrexone, although these were small. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of new treatments in this field."
CD007033,"There is evidence that the oral corticosteroids formoterol and budesonide are effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The two drugs are associated with significant reductions in the number of exacerbations, Dyspnoea scores and HR-QOL. These results suggest a role for the oral corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."
CD007066,There is evidence that aliskiren has an antihypertensive effect when used in single-daily doses. It is more effective than the oral antidiabetic drugs mitigated by the newer drugs or the older drugs or the combined therapies. It is more effective than the oral antihypertensive drugs mitigated by the newer drugs or the older drugs. It is more effective than the oral antihypertensive drugs Britannica and parenteral gold but not as effective as the oral antihypertensive drugs mitigated by the newer drugs or the combined therapies. It is unclear whether aliskiren has an antihypertensive
CD007124,There is evidence that carbamazepine has fewer side effects than controlled-release carbamazepine preparations. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of preparation.
CD007166,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of antiparkinsonian drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD007191,"There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in patients with HIV. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to determine whether antibiotics are effective for prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in patients with HIV."
CD007214,There is evidence that TENS may be effective for alleviating pain during labour. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. Further large studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of TENS treatment in women during labour.
CD007224,There is evidence that CABG is associated with a reduction in intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion requirements in patients undergoing CABG when compared to on-pump CABG. This is based on medium-term data. No evidence is available regarding the effect of cell saver CABG on postoperative morbidity and mortality. There is no evidence regarding the effect of CABG on postoperative quality of life and in terms of the number of patients receiving CABG are unknown.
CD007289,"There is evidence that prophylactic chemotherapy reduces the incidence of secondary trophoblastic disease in patients with complete hydatidiform mole. However, this data is not extrapolated to other patients or to other lines of treatment. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to determine the effectiveness of prophylactic chemotherapy for persistent trophoblastic disease in patients with complete hydatidiform mole."
CD007293,"There is evidence that cataract surgery is safe when performed without preoperative medical testing. However, there is no evidence that cataract surgery is safe when performed with routine medical testing. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the studies and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine if there are differences between groups or whether there are any differences between groups."
CD007294,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from interstitial chemotherapy when used locally in a biodegradable polymer at the tumour site. This treatment may be more effective than chemotherapy alone. The benefit of interstitial chemotherapy appears to be limited to recurrent gliomas. The benefit of interstitial chemotherapy appears to be limited to recurrent gliomas.
CD007298,There is no evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces bone loss in people with cystic fibrosis. There is some evidence that calcium supplementation reduces bone loss in people with cystic fibrosis. These data are not robust and need to be interpreted with caution.
CD007345,"Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to patients undergoing therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for reasons relating to their risk of septic complications. Patients should be offered antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of ERCP, as well as in the following days, but in any case, patients should be offered choice of antibiotic or placebo."
CD007350,"lenalidomide may be as effective as thalidomide in treating moderately severe Crohn's disease. However, there was insufficient evidence from trials on the period after treatment had finished and no evidence from the end point. This could explain why lenalidomide is not effective in treating people with moderately severe Crohn's disease. The potential benefits of lenalidomide in treating moderately severe Crohn's disease need to be evaluated in large scale studies along with rigorous safety data."
CD007394,"There is no high quality evidence that the ELISA test is effective for the surveillance of invasive aspergillosis. In patients with hematological malignancies, the test identifies abnormalities in the immune system that may be indicators of infection. In patients with cancer, the test identifies abnormalities in the immune system that may be indicators of infection. In patients with chronic lung disease, the ELISA test identifies abnormalities in the immune system that may be indicators of infection."
CD007404,The melanoma tumour response data collected in this review suggests that calcitonin may be a useful therapy for melanoma in adults. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm the findings of this review.
CD007414,"Topotecan appears to be ineffective as a consolidation treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. In patients with ovarian cancer who have responded to initial chemotherapy, topotecan is not associated with a significant delay in progression or in the rate of recurrence. However, many of the patients were at high risk of end-stage ovarian cancer and so the data on consolidation may not be interpretable. The low toxicity profile of topotecan appears to be consistent with other regimens of chemotherapy."
CD007428,There is evidence that Knowles fixation is superior to plate fixation in treating midclavicular fractures. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence is available regarding the quality of life or other outcomes in patients with midclavicular fractures treated with Knowles fixation.
CD007474,"Risperidone appears to be a useful antipsychotic in the treatment of schizophrenic patients with acute symptoms. In a review of randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality, the authors found no evidence that the drug had a significant effect on psychotic symptoms. In a review of randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality, the authors found no evidence that the drug had a significant effect on psychotic symptoms."
CD007480,"vitamin A supplementation at birth appears to reduce infant mortality. In a review of randomized controlled trials including high-quality controlled trials, we found no evidence of a mortality benefit from vitamin A supplementation in newborns. In addition, vitamin A supplementation appears to reduce infant stores. This could be because the vitamin is digested in the womb and therefore cached in the mother's breast milk. Further high quality trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of supplementation."
CD007519,No evidence is available using alcohol in the treatment of pain in patients with pancreatic cancer.
CD007566,There is some indication that physical exercise may be beneficial for the physical fitness of women breast cancer survivors. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD007579,"There is evidence that scopolamine may be effective for prevention of nausea and vomiting after cesarean delivery. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. There is no evidence that scopolamine reduces the incidence of nausea and vomiting, or that it reduces the incidence of itching."
CD007610,"There is evidence that progressive foot care, especially in the context of diabetes, can reduce the risk of serious foot complications. progressive foot care may be useful in reducing the use of healthcare services by people with diabetes."
CD007617,There is evidence that grief can cause serious harm to those around us. We recommend that people who are in the habit of thinking about ways to kill themselves stop and think about ways to prevent such actions.
CD007668,"Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) may be useful for men with antisocial personality disorder (APD) who are drug-dependent and living in the community. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of detailed outcome data. However, it seems desirable to carry out large-scale RCTs in this group."
CD007672,"There is some indication that making pain information available to the health care team, and in particular to oncologists, may improve the pain management of people with cancer. However, this evidence is limited due to the small number of people included in the studies and the small number of outcomes that were examined. Further studies are needed to determine if there are patients who may be more likely to respond to interventions that do not involve making pain information available to the health care team."
CD007693,There is evidence that fluoride use may be associated with an increased risk of enamel fluorosis. This is based on randomised controlled trials. No evidence is available regarding the impact of fluoride on tooth brushing habits or on the rate of fluorosis.
CD007708,There is some indication that nitric oxide donors may be effective for the treatment of retained placenta. This treatment may be more effective than drugs such as oxytocin or controlled umbilical cord traction because both drugs cause adverse effects. Further trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of nitric oxide donors.
CD007712,"venovenous bypass may be used to protect the kidneys during liver transplantation. However, there is limited evidence of a benefit from VVBP in alleviating renal failure in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The equipment used in this study is not foolproof and there is evidence of a risk of adverse effects from the VVBP equipment in the following patients: women with chronic liver disease, those undergoing liver transplant, those undergoing transplantation of a primary liver or a secondary liver, and those receiving a transplant of a primary liver or a secondary liver. These patients are all at high risk of dying from liver transplant. As a result,"
CD007718,"There is evidence that telephone follow-up is effective in increasing the confidence of patients to perform daily activities. This may be useful in reducing health care use and in decreasing the number of visits to the emergency department. However, there is no evidence that this is effective in reducing the number of patients hospitalised due to dyspnoea. This may be possible with the use of a more effective means of monitoring theophylline levels."
CD007771,"There is no evidence of effect of oral 25-hydroxyvitamin D on activity or clinical parameters in patients with RA. In view of the low quality of the trials, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be taken into consideration. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention-to-treat analysis to allow better external validity."
CD007806,"The topical painkiller regimen used in clinical trials to relieve pain after tonsillectomy is not equally effective in reducing pain in post-operative period. In one trial, the administration of topical painkiller bupivacaine hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain after tonsillectomy. In another trial, the administration of topical painkiller lidocaine hydrochloride resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain after tonsillectomy. The regimen of bupivacaine, dexamethasone, and lidocaine did not result in a statistically significant reduction in pain after tonsillectomy."
CD007872,There is evidence that the non-opioid drug tranexamic acid reduces postpartum blood loss. This finding is based on a small study and does not apply to current evidence. No specific recommendations can be made for the use of non-opioid drugs in the situation described.
CD007887,"Hydrocortisone appears to be beneficial for headache following spinal anesthesia. In patients with post-puncture headache who are undergoing spinal anesthesia, the beneficial effects appear to be modest. This could be because the patients are underpowered to tolerate the long-term effects of hydrocortisone. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of hydrocortisone in patients with post-puncture headache."
CD007926,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of progestin therapy in the treatment of advanced endometrial carcinoma.
CD007979,There is evidence that reminders can improve care after a fracture. One trial found that reminders resulted in higher BMD measurement and medication uptake than advice alone. This could be because the messages are more easily accessible. Further trials should examine the effectiveness of reminders in different patient populations and the number of participants who respond.
CD007986,"There is some indication that vitamin DHA supplementation may be beneficial for children with ADHD. In a review of randomized controlled trials including 42 participants, a significant trend was found that vitamin DHA supplementation increased FA levels in the blood of children with ADHD. This was despite the fact that most of the participants in the trials had no history of ADHD. The findings suggest that vitamin DHA supplementation may be beneficial for children with ADHD."
CD008012,"There is evidence that antidepressants can reduce mortality and mortality in patients with depressive disorders after myocardial infarction. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of antidepressant. Adverse events appear to be similar to placebo, although there is no evidence of safe or effective treatment. The evidence base is limited due to the small size of the studies and lack of standardisation in the choice of antidepressant."
CD008107,"There is evidence that trimodality therapy may offer a small clinically and statistically significant advantage over surgery alone in the treatment of patients with localized esophageal cancer. The results suggest that in a small number of patients, trimodality therapy may offer a small clinically and statistically significant advantage over surgery alone. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of patients included in the trials, the lack of detailed outcome information that could have prevented the conclusions of the review from being arrived at, and the lack of detailed outcome information that could have prevented the conclusions of the review from being arrived at."
CD008112,There is evidence that vertebral manipulation may be effective for treating chronic low back pain. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the assessments. Further studies are needed to determine whether vertebral manipulation is effective for treating chronic low back pain and to define the optimal dose and frequency of treatment.
CD008120,"Olanzapine may be a useful monotherapy treatment for social anxiety disorder. In a review of studies of this type, the authors found no evidence of a significant effect on outcome measures in patients with GAD who were not treated for antidepressants. There is some evidence of an effect of quetiapine on outcome measures in people with anxiety. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of quetiapine compared to other antipsychotic treatments, which is at present unclear."
CD008175,The melanoma outcomes data collected in this review of RCTs of vitamin D3 in patients with CKD are insufficient to support the use of any specific type of drug for melanoma. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD008186,There is some indication that exercise may be beneficial for people with stroke. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
CD008203,"Statins are effective for preventing cardiovascular events. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support their use in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. The risk of pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolism is higher with statin therapy. However, these effects are not statistically significant. Given the low incidence of venous thromboembolism, the risk of provoked venous thromboembolism is less. With limited evidence in the prevention of other serious outcomes, statins are not recommended for prevention of these."
CD008216,"There is evidence that the use of peripheral blood stem cells to support engraftment in patients with RMS and Ewing sarcoma is effective. In patients with metastatic RMS and Ewing sarcoma, the use of GCSF support reduces the incidence of treatment-related mortality and may improve hematologic recovery. In patients with metastatic RMS and Ewing sarcoma, the use of GCSF support may increase the rate of treatment-related mortality and may improve hematological recovery."
CD008241,"There is evidence that intramedullary nailing is effective for the treatment of closed, displaced tibial shaft fractures. The data are not conclusive on the relative effectiveness of the two methods of nailing, which may explain why there is no definitive evidence from studies on the effectiveness of both."
CD008253,There is no evidence of benefit in the treatment of nasal polyps in people with CF. There is limited evidence of benefit in the treatment of polyps in people with chronic lung disease. There is no evidence of benefit in the treatment of nasal polyps in people with chronic lung disease.
CD008288,We have not found evidence that the Ayurvedic intervention improves clinical outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. This is based on randomised controlled trials. No evidence was found that the intervention improved long term outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.
CD008302,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of rhTSH as a therapy for remnant ablation in patients with thyroid cancer. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. Until further evidence is established, this treatment method should be used only in patients with hypothyroidism."
CD008351,"There is evidence that chest physiotherapy may be effective for clearing the secretions from the lungs in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The evidence is limited due to the small number of patients studied, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to develop adjunct chest physiotherapy that might make it more effective for people with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis."
CD008361,There is evidence that NBI may be effective for the detection of adenomas during colonoscopy. This finding should be interpreted with caution until further evidence is established. There is no evidence that NBI is effective for the detection of non-polypoid adenomas. This finding should be interpreted with caution until further evidence is established.
CD008388,"There is evidence that VRT can improve visual function in people with visual field defects. The results suggest that in a two-pronged approach, VRT may be effective in improving visual function in people with visual field defects."
CD008391,"In the wake of the bombshell revelations about the Pentagon's mishandling of TBI data, we are seeing increasing calls for more rigorous studies of the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for people with TBI. This review provides some evidence that, when compared to standard rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation does not appear to offer a significant improvement in people's quality of life."
CD008424,"turmeric may be as effective as curcumin as a maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis. However, there is no evidence of effect in older patients or those with mild to moderate colitis. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of turmeric as a maintenance therapy for patients with moderate to severe colitis."
CD008449,"There is evidence that mirror therapy may be beneficial for hand function in stroke patients. In a review of 23 studies including 42 patients, moderate quality evidence showed that there was a 10% and 25% improvement in the rate of wrist, hand and coordination, respectively, in the mirror group compared to the control group. This evidence suggests that there is a role for NMES in improving hand function in stroke patients."
CD008454,"Use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including NSAIDs, is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease, according to one review. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that NSAIDs reduce the risk of Parkinson disease. There is also no evidence that the use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including NSAIDs, reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease."
CD008472,There is evidence that IP reduces the risk of myocardial and renal injury in patients undergoing elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. Further trials should clarify the rationale for IP and include further safety assessments to confirm the preliminary results from this review.
CD008493,"Atorvastatin appears to be beneficial for postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. In patients with histories of AF, the drug shows a small benefit. In patients with a previous history of C-reactive protein (CRP) toxicity, the drug shows a large benefit. This review has not examined economic data."
CD008510,There is no evidence to suggest the use of any specific type of treatment for vaginal bleeding in women of early threatened abortion with a dark area surrounding pregnancy sac.
CD008586,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of LEV versus PHT in controlling tumor-related seizures in patients with GBM.
CD008591,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that escitalopram and NARI reboxetine are effective in treating seasonal affective disorder. A third study evaluating NARI reboxetine in SAD should be undertaken. Until then, escitalopram and NARI reboxetine should be the go-to treatments for SAD."
CD008607,"Corticosteroids are used for treating acute vestibular vertigo. There is evidence that corticosteroids improve the symptoms of vestibular vertigo in patients with acute vestibular neuritis. The evidence is not conclusive due to the small number of patients included in the trials, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform randomised trials on specific corticosteroids."
CD008643,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of lumbar spine radiography for the diagnosis of low back pain. In patients with low back pain, radiological findings are often ambiguous, and the risk of serious consequences is low. Lumbar spine radiography may be useful for early diagnosis of serious lower back pain."
CD008765,"There is some indication that cytoreductive surgery may be beneficial for survivors of recurrent ovarian cancer. However, the evidence is not robust and further research is needed."
CD008838,There is evidence that venom therapy can reduce the extent of large local reactions to insect stings. This finding is based on a small study of limited methodological rigour.
CD008862,There is some indication that rTMS may be beneficial for hand function in patients with acute stroke. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of stimulation.
CD008870,There is no evidence that any specific drugs can be recommended for treatment of moderate and severe Crohn's disease. There is limited evidence that any specific drugs can be recommended for treatment of mild and moderate Crohn's disease. There is limited evidence that any specific drugs can be recommended for treatment of Crohn's disease.
CD008871,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) as a treatment for low-risk prostatic cancer. In comparison to brachytherapy, which is more effective in terms of lower mortality and longer-term outcomes, RRP appears to be superior in terms of safety and effectiveness. However, each study identified represents a different clinical setting in low-risk prostatic cancer and further research is needed to determine if there are differences between RRP and BT that may affect outcomes."
CD008890,"There is evidence that bleomycin treatment leads to a reduction in the volume of cysts, and a meta-analysis of 23 studies with 4213 patients suggests a 10% reduction in the volume of cysts after bleomycin treatment. However, most of the studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s and the evidence base is limited. Until further evidence is established, bleomycin treatment should be restricted to targeted therapy of craniopharyngiomas."
CD009072,There is no high quality evidence that photochemically treated platelets are more effective or safer than conventional platelets. There is limited evidence that the incidence of bleeding or serious adverse events following PCT platelets is increased. There is limited evidence that the incidence of lymphocytosis or other adverse events following PCT platelets is increased. These data do not support the continued use of PCT in transfusion support of patients with thrombocytopenic patients.
CD009109,"There is evidence that direct composite restoration results in a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in the rate of restoration of endodontically treated teeth. However, the data on crown failure and clinical success are limited due to the small number of studies included in the review. The results suggest that the risk of crown failure is similar for those restored with direct composite as for those restored with cast coverage."
CD009110,There is evidence that topical dressings are effective in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.
CD009118,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of enemas in the treatment of children with moderate and severe constipation. In children with moderate and severe constipation, enemas are more effective than oral PEG. However, the data on ease of passage and number of bowel movements are not conclusive. The effectiveness and effectiveness of PEG in the treatment of children with moderate and severe constipation is unclear."
CD009153,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reduce the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission among HIV-1 discordant couples. However, there is insufficient evidence for a significant effect on condom use and other risk behaviors in these couples. In addition, there is no evidence that the rate of transmission of HIV is reduced in couples with ART use. These couples may be at increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases when their HIV-1 index partners are not on ART. These couples may be at increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases when their HIV-1 index partners are not on ART. These couples may be at increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases when their"
CD009154,"There is evidence that gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists support implantation, implantation and pregnancy rates in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation-embryo transplant (ET) cycles. The results suggest that in a women with a thin endometrium, GnRH-a support is effective in improving implantation, implantation and pregnancy rates. In a women with a predisposing ovarian disorder, GnRH-a support is effective in improving the risk of early LH surge. The results suggest that in women with a predisposing ovarian disorder, GnRH-a support is effective in improving the"
CD009190,There is no evidence to support or refute the use of telephonic psycho-social support for rape survivors. It may be useful in reducing the frequency of missed doses of PEP and in improving adherence.
CD009192,There is evidence that telephone notification of HIV test results is more effective than face-to-face notification in increasing the number of youth receiving HIV test results and posttest counseling. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of method of notification.
CD009202,We found no clear evidence to support the use of any specific type of antiepileptics for the treatment of RSE. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the small sizes of the included studies. This review has not examined economic data.
CD009274,"Corticosteroids are effective in treating chronic rhinosinusitis, but there is evidence that they may be associated with adverse effects on wound healing. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm suggestions that corticosteroids may be associated with an adverse effect on wound healing in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis."
CD009275,"There is evidence that a low-GI diet can improve blood pressure in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, and it can reduce the need for insulin. However, there is no evidence that the effect of a low-GI diet on pregnancy and in particular on the quality of life of women with GDM is effective."
CD009308,This review provides some evidence to show that there is some evidence that interventions designed to prevent substance use in adolescents are effective.
CD009379,There is some indication that amniotic membrane transplantation may be beneficial in the treatment of acute ocular burns. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD009404,There is evidence that educational programs can be effective in reducing the incidence of wrong-site tooth extraction. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD009415,"There is evidence that zinc deficiency may be associated with an increase in serum testosterone, neutrophil zinc, and alkaline phosphatase activity in children with Sickle cell anemia. This could explain why there is a small but significant increase in serum testosterone in the zinc group. This could be because the immune system is more responsive to zinc than the other immune cells. These results do not support the continued use of zinc supplementation in children with anemia."
CD009461,We found some limited evidence that polypectomy may improve the rate of pregnancy in women with endometrial polyps. This is based on small studies. No evidence was found that the polypectomy improved pregnancy or pregnancy maintenance.
CD009593,There is no high quality evidence that the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay is effective for the detection of tuberculosis. It is not clear that it is effective for HIV-associated tuberculosis. There is no high quality evidence that the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay is effective for the detection of tuberculosis. It is not clear that it is effective for the detection of HIV-associated tuberculosis.
CD009755,There is no evidence that zinc supplements increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes or early mortality in HIV-infected women. There is no evidence that zinc supplements increase the risk of preterm birth or early mortality in HIV-infected women. There is no evidence that zinc supplements increase the risk of all-cause mortality or the risk of all-cause mortality in HIV-infected women.
CD009792,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. The use of misoprostol for induction of labour in women with previous cesarean deliveries is controversial. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised trials on this topic.
CD010256,"Theophylline, when added to continuous nebulized albuterol therapy and intravenous corticosteroids, is as effective as terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus. The addition of theophylline to baseline therapy is more cost-effective when compared with terbutaline alone or terbutaline and theophylline together. Theophylline should be considered for use early in the management of critically ill asthmatic children."
CD010257,"We found a small number of studies that showed a beneficial effect of antibiotics in acute exacerbations of COPD, although results were not always significant. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found using longer-term data."
CD010292,"No specific recommendations can be made for the first line treatment of pain in people with mild to moderateromyalgia. The update identified two new studies, both of high methodological quality, that suggest duloxetine may be effective for the treatment of pain in people with mild to moderateromyalgia."
CD010610,"Topiramate appears to be an effective preventive therapy for migraine. In a review of randomized controlled trials including 42 studies, the authors found no evidence of a significant reduction in monthly migraine frequency in thetreated group. A meta-analysis of the trials including 42 studies, including 42 studies in which statistically significant reductions were found, showed no evidence of a significant reduction in monthly migraine frequency in thetreated group."
CD010611,"There is evidence that valproic acid is effective for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. In clinical trials, valproic acid tends to be more effective in reducing frequency of migraine attacks than propranolol. However, there is no evidence that the benefits of valproic acid are equally pronounced in those with aura or in those with mild to moderate migraine. The availability of low-dose valproic acid is a major issue in the current treatment of migraine."
