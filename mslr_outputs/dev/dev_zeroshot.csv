459,CD009497,"In 193 fully evaluable patients who were studied for 5 years, allopurinol and DMSO incurred a significant (p < 0.05) survival advantage over the whole period of study. The similarity in efficacy between allopurinol and DMSO and the fact that the only action they share is scavenging oxyradicals, suggest that these radicals mediate the detrimental effects of malignancy and that removing them incurs a survival advantage for patients with advanced colonic cancer.."

461,CD009607,"Previous research suggests that physical activity programs may improve fitness and reduce symptoms in children with asthma, but few studies have included severe asthmatics and focused on safety and parental satisfaction with the programs. To examine safety, parental satisfaction, and pre- to post-intervention changes in symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in a pilot study of the impact of vigorous physical activity (swimming) and moderate-intensity activity (golf) on inner-city children with asthma. Children with asthma (7-14 years old) residing in Milwaukee's highest asthma prevalence zip codes were randomized to a 9-week swimming or golf program"
462,CD009662,"A comparative study of standard ERCP catheter and hydrophilic guide wire in the selective cannulation of the common bile duct. Deep cannulation of the common bile duct (CBD) is paramount for the success of endoscopic biliary intervention. The aim of the present study was to compare standard ERCP catheter and hydrophilic guide wire (HGW) in the selective cannulation of the CBD. In Group A (200 patients), the bile duct was first accessed by insertion of a soft-tipped Teflon tracer (diameter 0.035 inch) guidewire through a"
463,CD009779,"The role of early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and papillotomy in the treatment of patients who have acute biliary pancreatitis without obstructive jaundice is uncertain. We conducted a prospective, multicenter study in which 126 patients were randomly assigned to early ERCP (within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms) and endoscopic papillotomy for the removal of stones in the common bile duct, when appropriate, and 112 patients were assigned to conservative treatment. In the conservative-treatment group, ERCP was performed within three weeks if signs of biliary obstruction or se"

To estimate the effect of receiving HIV-positive test results on intentions to have future children and on contraceptive use and to assess the association between pregnancy intentions and pregnancy incidence among HIV-positive women in Malawi. Women who were HIV-positive and not pregnant were enrolled and followed for 1 year while receiving HIV care and access to family planning (FP) services. Before receiving their HIV test results, 33% of women reported a desire to have future children; this declined to 15% 1 week later (P"

A randomized double-blind clinical trial was performed to test the safety and efficacy of a low-molecular-weight heparin, tinzaparin (Innohep), for the management of acute painful vasoocclusive crisis characteristic of sickle cell anemia (SCA). In the treatment group, 127 patients received tinzaparin at 175 IU/kg, subcutaneous once daily, along with supportive care including morphine analgesia; in the control group,"
