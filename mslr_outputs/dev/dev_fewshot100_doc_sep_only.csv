CD000019,A single trial has shown a reduction in respiratory morbidity from the use of corticosteroids to thyrotropin-releasing hormone. This evidence is not significant compared to the use of corticosteroids alone or to the use of corticosteroids alone. There is no evidence from this review that the incidence of death is reduced.
CD000020,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of anti-D Ig in the treatment of secondary Rh D immunisation in women who are born rhesus negative. This would be a useful update to the review published in 2005. It was concluded that, while two doses of anti-D Ig may reduce alloimmunization, they are not as effective as two doses of 500iu in the previous trial."
CD000025,"Expectant management with magnesium sulfate in women with mild preeclampsia is not effective, and may lead to the development of more severe preeclampsia. Magnesium sulfate may be effective in preventing eclampsia. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of magnesium sulfate in this manner. In view of the modest number of women studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously."
CD000036,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of ritodrine in the treatment of intrauterine growth retardation. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD000052,"No specific recommendations can be made for the first line treatment of acute asthma in adults with a spacer, as all three delivery methods showed equivocal efficacy. Other factors such as local guidelines and preferences, ease of use, costs and availability must therefore be taken into consideration in deciding the type and quantity of treatment of acute asthma in adults."
CD000088,There is evidence that psychoeducational treatments for people with schizophrenia are effective. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from psychoeducational treatment regarding mortality.
CD000093,"There is evidence that the gamma nail is an alternative to dynamic hip screw in the treatment of peri-trochanteric fractures of the femur. In elderly patients, the gamma nail may be more effective in terms of time to healing, complications and time to discharge than the dynamic hip screw. However, there was no evidence that the gamma nail was more effective than dynamic hip screw in the treatment of peri-trochanteric fractures of the femur."
CD000126,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the US there is no evidence of effect of local anaesthesia on outcomes of carotid surgery. There is limited evidence in this review of the effectiveness of local anaesthesia compared to other methods of anaesthesia, including epidural anaesthesia, and in particular of the effect of local anaesthesia on stroke and myocardial infarction."
CD000148,"There is no evidence of effect of carnitine substitution for bed rest in women with placental insufficiency. There is a risk of side effects from the use of carnitine substitution, when used in long term treatment of placental insufficiency."
CD000164,"Antenatal phenobarbital appears to be effective in reducing the frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage and in decreasing the severity of ICH in infants. In view of the modest number of participants in the studies, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously."
CD000165,"The previous version of this review showed that general practitioners offered advice to people about their smoking habits and their ability to stop in a clinical setting was effective in reducing the use of smoking cessation measures. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of patients, general practitioners do not offer any specific advice regarding smoking cessation."
CD000187,"Despite the shortcomings of the present review, the results suggest that indobufen may be a useful adjunct to oral anticoagulation in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The beneficial effects of indobufen for the secondary prevention of major vascular events in NRAF patients are not clear due to the high attrition bias, the small number of participants and the short follow-up."
CD000201,"Oxytocin alone is not effective in preventing postpartum haemorrhage. The use of ergometrine as a component of active management of the third stage of labour is associated with a lower incidence of postpartum nausea, vomiting and headache than the use of oxytocin alone. However, the incidence of retained placenta is higher in the ergometrine group (odds ratio 3.7; 95% CI 1.03-12.5) than in the oxytocin group ("
CD000212,"Sulphasalazine appears to be beneficial for patients with PsA. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of stiffness, duration of morning stiffness and ESR. Sulfasalazine appears to be beneficial for patients with PsA. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of stiffness, duration of morning stiffness and ESR."
CD000277,"The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. However, it is clear from the literature that magnesium treatment reduces risk of ischemic dysfunction and may reduce the risk of cerebral ischemia. In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, magnesium treatment reduces frequency and severity of cerebral bleeding or ischemic deficits. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic."
CD000301,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of active Crohn's disease. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD000313,"For patients with congestive heart failure, ICPs may be useful in reducing re-hospitalisation and improving quality of life. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the intervention is indicated focusing on earlier discharge. Patients with congestive heart failure can be more easily lured into hospital by"
CD000328,"There is no evidence to suggest that HFJV reduces mortality or pulmonary morbidity in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome and it is possible that it may increase these. These data do not support the continued use of HFJV in the treatment of RDS. However, it should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD000332,"HuEPO appears to be beneficial for patients with RA. In comparisons with placebo, a significant reduction in CRP was seen in the Epo group, although not significant in the placebo group. No significant changes in energy level or Ritchie index were seen in the patients receiving HuEPO. However, long term data are lacking."
CD000353,There is some indication that adjunctive homeopathic remedies may be effective for children with asthma. This evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies and the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes.
CD000361,IVIG may be effective in preventing sepsis in preterm and low-birth weight infants. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on the use of IVIG for prevention of sepsis in these infants.
CD000387,"Laparoscopy may be a useful adjunct to therapy for women with chronic pelvic pain. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of laparoscopic surgery for chronic pelvic pain. Women with chronic pelvic pain cannot be recommended for any specific type of therapy."
CD000391,"There is evidence from one trial that methotrexate reduces steroid requirement in patients with severe asthma without impacting on pulmonary function or clinical quality. This results from a small study that was unable to account for the absence of any differences between methotrexate and placebo, or between methotrexate and placebo. There is no apparent reduction in adverse events from the use of methotrexate in asthma."
CD000407,Corticosteroids are used for treating patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis. The beneficial effects of corticosteroids on long term clinical outcomes are not clear.
CD000412,Use of combined therapies for polycystic ovarian disease and/ or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in women with fertility-related conditions is not effective. Results from one trial suggested that the administration of combined therapy with GnRH during the follicular phase is associated with a lower rate of premature luteinization and pregnancy rates. Further trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal regimen for polycystic ovarian disease and/ or gonadotropin-
CD000424,We have not found evidence to support the use of bromocriptine for people with chronic non-fluent aphasia. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field.

CD000498,"There is currently insufficient evidence to support the routine use of fibrinolytic endoventricular treatment in babies with post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The update identified six new patients who were treated with streptokinase infusion, which did not show a significant effect in hydrocephalus. These new patients did not show the same side effects from the use of fibrinolytic endoventricular treatment."
CD000503,"We have not found evidence that a small increase in fluid intake from formula decreases mortality and morbidity from the small numbers of infants studied in this review. However, it is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for practice."
CD000527,"There is unclear evidence that artemether is more effective than quinine in the treatment of severe malaria. In children with severe malaria, artemether tends to be more effective in terms of lower mortality and longer parasite clearance time than quinine. However, most studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate"
CD000566,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of hyperventilation in patients with severe head injury. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD000954,Ketanserin appears to be ineffective for the treatment of primary Raynaud's Phenomenon. The results do not apply to secondary Raynaud's phenomenon or to the mechanism of action of the antagonist. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of ketanserin.
CD000968,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of attention training for people with schizophrenia. The current review provides evidence that in a small sample size, attention training may be effective in terms of improvement in people with schizophrenia."
CD001021,"tobramycin when used as a primary treatment for chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is effective, but there is a significant reduction in pulmonary function when used as a primary treatment. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the tobramycin groups despite the inability to tailor the antibiotic in these fixed dose regimens. Adverse effects were consistent with the previous version of this review. Further high quality,"
CD001035,"The POWER social marketing campaign appears to be effective in reducing HIV risk and condom use in women of color. It is clear from the literature that this intervention is effective in reducing HIV risk and condom use in women of color. However, there is insufficient evidence for HIV prevention and sexually transmitted disease (STD) in women of color and women of color. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies,"

CD001125,"There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hirsutism. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of CPA compared to flutamide in the treatment of hirsutism properly."
CD001158,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of prednisone treatment with chloroquine in the treatment of RA. Patients with RA did not report serious adverse effects from prednisone treatment, when compared to chloroquine. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of other second-line drugs in the treatment of RA."
CD001177,"EMLA appears to be beneficial for the pain of venous leg ulcers. In comparisons with placebo, pain relief was increased with the use of EMLA. However, there was no significant evidence for or against the use of EMLA in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. The available evidence is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of EMLA in the treatment of venous leg ulcers."
CD001181,There is increasing evidence that antibiotics prophylaxis is effective in preventing infections. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of antibiotics to confirm the preliminary results from this review.

CD001190,"The previous version of this review showed that donepezil had some small improvements in cognitive function in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease when compared to no treatment or placebo. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of patients, donepezil does not increase the risk of serious and possibly fatal adverse events. Donepezil may be a useful treatment for cognitive function in people with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease."
CD001211,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about ciprofloxacin 's lack of efficacy in treating acute conjunctivitis did not change. Given availability of more effective treatments including topical antibiotics, ciprofloxacin may be more effective than vehicle in treating acute conjunctivitis. However, many of the trials were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate"
CD001216,"The two studies in this review, both of them reporting on women, did not show a significant effect on mortality from colorectal cancer without screening.

CD001263,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of cefoperazone-sulbactam and ceftazidime, moderate quality evidence suggests that these regimens are effective in treating acute melioidosis. Culture-confirmed relapse occurred in one patient randomized to the cefoperazone-sulbactam regimen and in 11 (25.6%) randomized to the cotrimoxazole regimen, although these results were not statistically significant. Doxycycline"
CD001281,"Salmeterol is more effective than theophylline in reducing night-time symptoms and in decreasing respiratory disturbances in patients with nocturnal asthma. However, recent studies have shown that THEO may delay sleep onset and may have adverse effects on respiratory function. In these comparisons salmeterol is more effective than theophylline in reducing night-time symptoms and in decreasing respiratory disturbances in patients with nocturnal asthma"
CD001301,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ICSI for non-male-factor infertility. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised trials on this topic.
CD001321,Participant numbers in each comparison were small and we found no clear differences between cranberry extract and placebo.

CD004479,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manual aspiration for patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. It is possible that the small number of patients studied in this review may have prevented the use of chest tube drainage for patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.
CD004522,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of thermal therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Where possible, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial. The low mortality from osteoarthritis is a relevant evidence base for the treatment of this chronic disease."
CD004530,"Ciprofloxacin is an efficacious but imperfect treatment for enteric fever. It prolongs symptoms and may increase the risk of relapse. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the ciprofloxacin groups despite the inability to tailor treatment. Comparisons of regimens using different antibiotics are necessary, particularly for advanced infections."
CD004544,"Variceal bleeding is a important clinical outcome in cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis and high-risk esophageal varices, Ligation is effective in terms of lower bleeding rates and in preventing the first variceal bleeding.

There is increasing evidence that different combinations of ibuprofen and acetaminophen are effective in treating postoperative pain."
CD004614,We found some limited evidence of effects on practice attributable to changes in the way drugs are packaged. It is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for practice. Qualitative drug testing to determine the effectiveness of pre-packaging and counselling is needed.

CD004851,"Escitalopram appears to be beneficial for adolescents with major depressive disorder. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in rate of response to treatment, severity of depressive disorder, and clinical outcomes. Adolescent depression appears to be associated with more adverse events than psychotherapy. However, these events were not statistically significant. The evidence to date may justify the development and evaluation of the use of citalopram for adolescents with major depressive disorder."
CD004854,There is evidence that psychoeducation may be effective for preventing relapse in people with bipolar disorder. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. psychoeducation may be more effective than psychosocial interventions in reducing relapse rates and improving treatment compliance.

CD004907,"We found no evidence regarding the effectiveness of active management of labour in reducing the rate of cesarean section and in decreasing the rate of maternal mortality. There was a small reduction in the rate of cesarean section when women were given active management, but this was not statistically significant. The use of active management of labour appears to be similar to that of traditional management, although there may be a risk of side effects."
CD004916,"Participant numbers in each comparison were small and we found no clear differences between PALs and non-PALs. The use of PAL in progression is associated with more adverse events, such as photophobia and myopia progression. Larger studies are needed to assess robust outcomes such as safety."

CD009401,"There is evidence from one trial that inclusion of SoF table in a review improves understanding and rapid retrieval of key information. However, there is no evidence that this improves practice. Further studies are needed to determine if the results of the intervention are consistent with the other studies, and to define the optimal design of such trials."
CD009411,"BeAM-HSCT may be effective in improving survival and freedom from treatment failure in patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease. It may be more effective than myeloablative therapy in reducing mortality and improving time-to-progression (TTP) in these patients. However, there is no significant difference in overall survival or time-to-progression from BEAM-HSCT. This may be because of the small number of participants in this trial and the lack of standard"

Adverse events were consistent with the smaller studies. The"
CD010119,"The use of routine monitoring and evaluation systems to assess a model of family planning incorporating HIV testing and testing is effective in reducing the use of HIV testing in family planning services. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in other settings. In Ethiopia, where home-based HIV testing is more effective than facility-based HIV testing, home-based HIV testing may be more effective than facility-based HIV testing. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in other settings. In Rwanda where home-based HIV testing is more"
