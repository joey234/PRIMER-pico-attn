CD000020,"There is some indication that the use of anti-D immunoglobulin treatment in the treatment of pre-term women with rhesus D positive infants is effective. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. Adverse events appear to be similar to those used in the control group, although immunisation may be important in preventing the adverse effects of this treatment. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies prophylaxis."

CD001035,"We found some limited evidence of effects on HIV risk when women receive HIV prevention counseling, video and application of information-motivated behaviour skills. However, the evidence was not significant for the use of intervention in women with high risk of HIV infection. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct studies that might make it easier to compare"
CD001054,"There is some indication that health visitor visits in people aged 70 and over may be effective for preventing disability and falls. However, the evidence is not significant for the long term. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."

CD001263,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of four drug regimens for the treatment of severe melioidosis, moderate quality evidence suggests that cotrimoxazole plus doxycycline is a effective maintenance treatment for severe melioidosis. Adverse effects were similar to placebo, although immunogenicity was an issue. Adverse effects were consistent with the two studies included in this review. The conclusions of the review did not change."
CD001281,We found some limited evidence of effects on safety from the use of second-controller medications in patients with nocturnal asthma. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing second-controller medications with other therapies such as corticosteroids or theophylline.
CD001301,We found no evidence to support the use of ICSI for severe male-factor infertility. Our review of the current evidence does not support a role for ICSI in infertility treatment.
CD001321,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of cranberry prophylaxis for women with recurrent urinary tract infections. The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression.
CD001327,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of the use of prophylactic antibiotics for IUD insertion and prophylactic IUD prophylaxis in reducing the risk of pelvic infection and improving health-related outcomes.

CD001356,"With or without surgery, most of the patients who had an injury of the anterior cruciate ligament were happy with the outcome after a period of time. The results were similar to those seen with no intervention or with conservative treatment. Injuries to the medial collateral ligament could not be demonstrated to benefit from surgical treatment in any respect--with or without surgery the results were excellent. With injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament, recovery was more rapid without surgery but otherwise the differed in one respect. The results were good in both treatment even though most of the patients who had an injury of the anterior cruciate ligament"

CD001708,"The two trials comparing internal fixation with cyclical arthroplasty and cyclical hemiarthroplasty were underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between them. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing internal fixation with cyclical arthroplasty or with no intervention. There was a 10% and 42% reduction in the rate of mortality and complications after internal fixation, respectively, when compared with no intervention. These results apply to patients over the age"
CD001717,There is no evidence to suggest that antipsychotic drugs perphenazin and fluspirilene are superior to placebo. The more pronounced sedative effect of prophylactically prescribed antiparkinsonian drugs is at least possible in patients with psychoses that are not associated with psychoses.
CD001724,"There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the value of GTR for the treatment of intabony defects in periodontal surgery. This review provides some evidence that in the treatment of intabony defects, GTR may be more effective than no intervention or flap treatment; it does not, however, provide a definitive answer on the relative effectiveness of different GTR methods in the treatment of intabony defects."

CD001777,"With only a few studies meeting inclusion criteria, and with limited useable data in these studies, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions. The preliminary pattern of evidence suggests that IUDs are effective in preventing bleeding and preventing termination of pregnancy. Adverse events are similar to non- IUDs, although there is a possibility that the lack of beneficial effects of IUDs in preventing bleeding and preventing termination of pregnancy may be a false negative result due to the paucity of the existing evidence."
CD001829,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of topical lycopene for the treatment of oral leukoplakia. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. However, it is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for the use of topical lycopene for the treatment of oral leukoplakia."

In children with epilepsy and in the general population the ketogenic diet is effective in reducing seizure frequency and in preventing the"
CD001914,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral protein energy supplements for children with cystic fibrosis. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct studies to allow better external validity."
CD001929,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of reflexology for chronic low back pain. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001950,"There is evidence that clonazepam is effective in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced akathisia in older adolescents. In comparisons with placebo, the symptoms of neuroleptic-induced akathisia were significantly less effective at reducing and reducing scores at the end of the first treatment week than with placebo. These results support the potential usefulness of clonazepam in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced youths."
CD001951,"Higher doses of haloperidol than are currently available are effective in the treatment of acute schizophrenia, but the long term safety data on the use of haloperidol in this manner is unknown.

CD002192,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of premedication of anxiolysis in day-case surgery. This review provides some evidence to show that the use of premedication of anxiolysis in day-case surgery is not effective, and that the use of oral temazepam is associated with a higher level of sedation than the use of oral premedication. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be conducted in patients undergoing day"
CD002232,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of cefotaxime in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. It is possible that the beneficial effects of cefotaxime in the treatment of peritonitis without an increase in short-term adverse consequences are not adequately demonstrated.
CD002238,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of imipramine for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. The results of the review confirm the existing evidence from randomized controlled trials of imipramine and psychotherapy as effective for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis.

CD002744,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment for children with asthma. This treatment is associated with a small clinically significant reduction in time to symptom alleviation and may be useful in preventing respiratory infections.
CD002751,"Active compression-decompression CPR is effective in reducing rate of hospital discharge and improving survival and return of spontaneous circulation in patients with pre-hospital cardiac arrest. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of active compression-decompression CPR in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The available evidence is not adequate to recommend the use of active compression-decompression CPR in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest"
CD002759,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the value of resistance training for people with chronic heart failure. The results suggest that progressive resistance training may improve muscle strength in affected people.

CD002778,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of acupuncture for people with temporomandibular disorders. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct trials that would make acupuncture more effective than simply using it in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders."
CD002787,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of nitric oxide therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods of treatment, the review authors recommend the use of randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour.

CD002830,"Droperidol appears to be a useful medication for management of acutely agitated patients. In the initial management of acutely agitated patients, droperidol may be used as a precursor to other psychotropics such as methotrexate or parenteral gold. In the evaluation of the side effects of droperidol, side effects could be attributed to the double blind medication."
CD002863,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of metoprolol treatment with chelated equine antibiotics in the treatment of hypertension during pregnancy.

CD002929,There is no evidence to suggest that the use of face masks reduces surgery wound infection rates. There is a risk that the use of face masks may increase the risk of surgical site infection.
CD002943,"There is evidence that mammography is effective in terms of uptake among women who are asked to attend mammography, and that invitations are effective in terms of uptake. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of invitation-based breast screening in the US. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD002969,"We found no clear evidence to support or refute the use of art therapy for children with leukemia. The modes of AT before, during, and after the punctures were as follows: clinical dialogue to calm children and help them cope with painful procedures; structured psychosocial treatment that may be offered to parents of children with leukemia. The use of art therapy for children with leukemia is safe and effective, and should be offered to all parents of children with leukemia."
