CD000019,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in respiratory distress syndrome was achieved by the use of corticosteroids alone. The results suggest that the addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to corticosteroids reduces the incidence of respiratory disease in preterm infants.
CD000020,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of antepartum prophylaxis of rhesus-negative women with no previous story of blood transfusions or of terminations of pregnancy. The results suggest that routine antepartum prophylaxis of rhesus-negative women with no previous story of blood transfusions or of terminations of pregnancy is effective.
CD000025,There is little evidence to suggest that magnesium sulfate prevents eclampsia in women with mild preeclampsia. The drug is effective in reducing blood pressure in these women but does not reduce the number of births.

CD000566,"There is still controversy over whether or not patients should be hyperventilated after traumatic brain injury, and a randomized trial has never been conducted. The theoretical advantages of hyperventilation are cerebral vasoconstriction for intracranial pressure (ICP) control and reversal of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acidosis. Accordingly, a trial was performed with patients randomly assigned to receive normal ventilation (PaCO2 35 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation): control group), hyperventilation (PaCO2 25 +/- 2 mm Hg: HV group), or hyperventilation plus THAM"
CD000954,"No studies have compared ketanserin with other active comparators such as dopamine agonists or monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

CD001021,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of inhaled tobramycin compared with no intervention or placebo in preventing and improving lung function in people with cystic fibrosis colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results suggest that progressive respiratory failure due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is possible in people with CF when inhaled tobramycin is treated with 300mg per day of tobramycin. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing entacapone with active comparators. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to compare inhaled tob
CD001035,We have not found evidence that a formal structured intervention has reduced HIV infection or pregnancy in high-risk female adolescents. The results suggest that progressive resisted intervention may reduce infection and pregnancy in these women.
CD001054,"We have not found evidence that a significant benefit has been found from the use of preventive home visits on people with visual impairment. The results suggest that a modest, one-time prevention program appeared to confer short-term health benefits on ambulatory HMO enrollees, although benefits diminished by the second year of follow-up. The mechanisms by which the intervention may have improved outcomes require further investigation."

It has been more effective than exercise coaching in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people but it has been more effective than exercise coaching in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people.
CD003248,There is little evidence to suggest that delayed cord clamping reduces the incidence of respiratory impairment and hematocrits in preterm infants. It does not appear to reduce the need for packed red cell transfusions or myoglobin levels after birth.
CD003254,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of intrapartum antibiotic therapy on the outcomes of women with intra-amniotic infection. The results suggest that intrapartum antibiotic therapy leads to lower incidence of neonatal sepsis and a shorter neonatal hospital stay than immediate postpartum treatment.
CD003265,There is little evidence to suggest that a benefit exists from the addition of methenamine hippurate or cranberry tablets to the usual regimen of patients with neuropathic bladder following SCI. The results suggest that there is no benefit from the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in these people.
CD003277,No studies have compared CLB with other antiepileptic drugs such as dopamine agonists or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. There is only limited evidence to suggest use of oral administration of CLB is effective in reducing the number of drop attacks and major motor seizures. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No studies have compared oral administration of CLB with other antiepileptic drugs such as dopamine agonists or monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
CD003283,We found no clear evidence to support routine use of oral contraceptives with no pregnancies.
CD003289,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two studies on the effectiveness of motivational interviewing and the online portal for adolescent smoking cessation.

CD003989,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between oral contraceptives containing 100 micrograms of entinyl estradiol and those containing 150 micrograms of desogestrel. The results suggest that the two formulations are comparable in terms of fertility.
CD003993,We have not found evidence that a significant benefit has been found from the use of thymosin fraction V in patients with cancer while reducing infection and fever. This could be because the drug is administered in a way that avoids the need for chemotherapy.
CD004001,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of spinal cord stimulation on limb salvage in patients with inoperable critical limb ischaemia. The results suggest that SCS may reduce amputation levels in patients with severe inoperable leg ischaemia and be most effective in patients without arterial hypertension.

CD004139,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of G-CSF on myelosuppression after cancer chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The results suggest that G-CSF may reduce the number of days with fever and intravenous antibiotics and reduce the number of days spent in hospital. However, this could be because the studies were underpowered to detect uncommon adverse effects such as pneumonia."
CD004147,"We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in opioid use/death was achieved when people were treated with permissive mindset. Instead, we found that the benefits of permissive mindset were more effective than control in reducing opioid use/death when compared with no intervention or control."
CD004168,"There is little evidence to suggest that ignition interlocks are effective in reducing impaired driving recidivism while on the vehicle. However, the practical effectiveness of these devices is limited because only a small number of offenders are willing to install them in order to drive legally. This paper reports on a study of a court policy that created a strong incentive for impaired driving offenders to install interlocks by making traditional penalties, such as jail or electronically monitored house arrest, the alternative to participation in an interlock program."

CD004249,There is little evidence to suggest that a more specific approach would be more effective in the treatment of people with cervical pain. Certain people tend to experience pain when progressiveneck pain is treated with manual therapies. This could be because they are more convenient than permissive therapy.
CD004251,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in pain was achieved when people were treated with perioperative magnetic stimulation or when they were treated with no intervention. The results suggest that PEMT may offer a more effective treatment than control groups when it comes to reducing pain in people with cervical pain.
CD004296,"The benefits of triflusal have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution.

CD004727,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of HBO on burn patients. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effect of HBO on burn patients properly."
CD004762,"We have not found evidence that a significant benefit exists from the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in the treatment of myotonia. The benefits of myotonia control with pharmacological agents must be weight against the risk of therapy in the individual patient. Because of the risks of hematologic problems, TCD is not recommended by us for the treatment of myotonia."
CD004764,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between groups for the pain of corneal abrasions or the number of painkiller doses taken. There is no apparent benefit from the use of eye patching on the pain of corneal abrasions or the number of painkiller doses taken.
CD004794,"We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in diarrhoea has been achieved by the use of perioperative antibiotics. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of perioperative antibiotics, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD004796,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of chiropractic manual therapy on crying time in infants with colic. The results suggest that chiropractic spinal manipulation is effective in relieving infantile colic.

CD005123,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of perineal massage during pregnancy compared to no intervention or control group. The results suggest that perineal massage may reduce tear rates and improve satisfaction with the delivery experience in women with a previous vaginal birth. However, this does not apply to women with a previous vaginal birth or women with no previous vaginal birth."
CD005125,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on wound infection and breakdown after vaginal delivery. The results suggest that prophylactic antibiotics may prevent wound infection and breakdown when administered to patients before or after third- or fourth-degree perineal tears are repaired.
CD005168,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in depressive symptoms was achieved when patients were treated with metyrapone prophylactically before they were treated with placebo.

CD005187,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from influenza vaccination of care home staff.
CD005232,"There is little evidence to suggest that oral steroids are effective in reducing symptoms of nasal polyps. The results suggest that a small-term benefit could be achieved with the use of oral steroids. However, this could easily have been missed with the small sample sizes in the two eligible studies. The studies were greatly underpowered to detect uncommon adverse effects such as pyloric stenosis. Additional controlled trials are required to determine whether oral steroids are effective or not in people with severe nasal polyposis."
CD005249,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of nasogastric feeding methods in neonates.
CD005272,"There is little evidence to suggest that a formal intervention could reduce the risk for HIV infection in women sex workers in Madagascar. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of alternative male and female condom promotion strategies in reducing STI prevalence and reducing HIV infection in women sex workers."
CD005287,"No studies have compared raloxifene with other classes of drug in the treatment of leiomyomas.

CD005482,"We have not found evidence that a significant benefit has been found from structured treatment interruptions in people with chronic HIV-1 infection. While the benefits of the treatment of HIV-1 infection have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of controlled re-exposures to autologous HIV-1. This could be because the initial benefits of HAART are more easily accessible to people with limited resources."
CD005485,The studies were underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between Pegasus Cairwave Therapy System and Aura cushion. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing Pegasus Cairwave Therapy System with other pressure-relieving systems. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to determine whether there is a difference between Pegasus Cairwave Therapy System and Aura cushion in the treatment of pressure ulcers in acute hospital setting.

CD005515,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of repelling magnets on the treatment of anterior open bite and compare them with the effects of acrylic posterior bite-blocks. Twenty patients, aged 9-16 years with skeletal anterior open bite, were randomly divided into two groups. Patients who had not undergone treatment served as the control group, whereas a second group was treated with lip-seal training and the FR-4 appliance. Chronologic mean decimal age at initial period of the investigation was 8.7 years in the treated group, and 8.9 years in the control group. Treatment and observation periods were 2 years."
CD005533,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the benefits of adding salmeterol to inhaled corticosteroids and the benefits that could be gained from the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled corticosteroids. The benefits of adding salmeterol to inhaled corticosteroids are more pronounced than those of leaving them alone. This could be because the initial benefits seen in the current studies are more equivocal. Short-term data indicate that the initial benefits of adding salmeterol to inhaled corticosteroids are more pronounced than those in other medium-term trials. Long
CD005550,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone on outcomes after cardiopulmonary bypass. The results suggest that dexamethasone reduces the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass but does not affect the immediate features after surgery or changes in vWf:Ag or S100B.
CD005555,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the outcomes examined in this review and other studies. The results suggest that perioperative phacoemulsification and IOL implantation is effective in preventing and controlling glaucoma in people with angle-closure glaucoma. However, a true benefit could easily have been missed with the small sample sizes in the two eligible studies.

Additional controlled trials are required to determine whether perioperative phacoemulsification and IOL implantation is effective in preventing and controlling glau"
CD005556,"The benefits of topical N-acetylcysteine have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of topical N-acetylcysteine, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD005565,We found no clear evidence to support routine comparison of corticosteroids with 6-methylprednisolone when treating patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with no evidence of improvement. The results suggest that early treatment of acute GVHD with 6MPred does not improve the response rate as compared with 2 mg/kg/d. nor does it prevent evolution to aGvHD grade III-IV.
CD005571,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing wound infection after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

CD005968,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of oral implants on the crestal bone changes when they are placed in periapical lesions. The results suggest that immediate implant placement may be considered a valuable therapeutic option for selected cases of single-tooth replacement when TE implants are used. However, this could be because the initial implant placement is more convenient than the later insertion of a peri-implant."
CD006001,We found no clear evidence to support routine biliary drainage with the aim of improving liver function in patients with cancer of the biliary duct.
CD006014,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit from debulking surgery exists in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus.

CD006247,The results suggest that a larger randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of food safety guidelines in minimizing the risk of food borne infection is safe and feasible in children with cancer.
CD006254,The calcimimetic agent R-568 reduces parathyroid hormone and calcium x phosphorus levels in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. It is more effective than control in reducing PTH and calcium x phosphorus levels in these people but more equivocal in the effect on PTH and calcium x phosphorus levels. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing R-568 with other calcimimetic agents such as calcimimetic agents or placebo. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to determine whether the initial benefits seen in short-term clinical trials
CD006269,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit from hyperthermia is available in patients with cancer while increasing the risk for burn.
CD006325,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of I/A-CDP on tumoricidal effects of primary osteosarcoma. The results suggest that I/A-CDP may improve cancer symptoms in patients with osteosarcoma but may worsen in others.

CD006429,"There is little evidence to suggest that exercise can be improved in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when breathing air or supplemental oxygen is administered. The benefits of oxygen have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of supplemental oxygen, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD006459,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the use of ultrasound and nerve stimulation for the success of perivascular axillary plexus blocks. The results suggest that the use of ultrasound may improve the quality of sensory and motor blocks when compared with no intervention. This could be because the initial experience of block is more tactile than with nerve stimulation.

CD006921,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral and intravenous treatment of people with MS after a relapse. The results suggest that oral treatment is effective in reducing the number of Gd-enhancing lesions after 1 week from treatment initiation.
CD006955,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of early occupational health management on the outcomes of people with low back pain. The results suggest that the benefits of early occupational health management may be more effective than traditional case management in reducing sickness absenteeism.
CD006971,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two methods of administering commercially available dinoprostone for preinduction cervical ripening. Sixty-nine women were randomized to receive one of two commercially available agents for cervical ripening. Half the patients received a gel containing 0.5 mg of dinoprostone. The other half were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5 mg of prostaglandin E2 or no intervention. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing entacervical and vaginal gel.
CD006981,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of botulinum toxin type B on sialorrhea in patients with ALS. The results suggest that treatment of sialorrhea with botulinum toxin type B may improve local symptoms of the disease in affected glands.
CD006989,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal glucocorticosteroids compared to H1-antihistamines in the treatment of SAR during the pollen season. The results suggest that the use of intranasal glucocorticosteroids alone is superior to the use of H1-antihistamines in the treatment of SAR during the pollen season. However, this could be because the two studies were separated into two groups."
CD007004,"We have not found evidence that aldosterone reduces blood pressure or albuminuria in people with chronic kidney disease when treated with spironolactone. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of aldosterone blocker in reducing proteinuria and lowering blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease when treated with spironolactone."

CD007031,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two studies comparing Ciclesonide with fluticasone propionate. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD007079,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in the risk for preeclampsia was achieved from oral calcium supplementation in women with low calcium intake. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD007119,No studies have compared alteplase with other active comparators such as pyloric stenosis inhibitors or myoclonus inhibitors. There is only limited evidence to suggest use of recombinant urokinase is effective in restoring function to occluded central venous access devices.
CD007145,"Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is a major risk factor for postpartum weight retention and future weight gain and obesity in women, but few adequately powered randomized controlled trials have examined the efficacy of a behavioral weight-control intervention during pregnancy. This is because the glucose is the main energy substrate for intrauterine growth. The benefits of exercise have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of exercise"
CD007176,"We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit from vitamin E supplementation has been found in people with coronary disease or cancer. However, the benefits have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of antioxidant vitamins, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD007189,"We found no clear evidence to support oral antiretroviral drug monotherapy of men who have sex with men with HIV. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of antiretroviral drug monotherapy in preventing sexually transmitted infections in these people."
CD007196,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of delay on QALYs in patients with biliary colic. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes.

CD007202,No studies have compared the use of pacifiers with other sources of encouragement such as breastfeeding or cry/fuss behavior. There is only limited evidence to suggest that use of pacifiers is associated with a lower frequency or shorter duration of breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life.
CD007204,"We found no clear evidence to support routine use of dronabinol in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of dronabinol in the treatment of anorexia."
CD007230,"We found no clear evidence to support routine use of edaravone in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, this could easily have been missed with the small sample sizes in the two eligible studies. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to verify the effectiveness of edaravone in preventing ischemic stroke and improving functional outcomes."

CD007302,No studies have compared vigabatrin with other antiepileptic drug classes such as dopamine agonists or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. There is only limited evidence to suggest use of oral GVG is effective in people with refractory epilepsy. The results suggest that a small reduction in seizure frequency was achieved when patients were treated with oral GVG compared with no intervention. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD007303,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit from the use of epoetin beta has been reached in patients with cancer while reducing transfusion requirements or reducing hemoglobin levels. This could be because theapy is more effective than placebo in reducing anaemia in these people.
CD007360,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between naftopidil and tamsulosin hydrochloride for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD007388,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on myoclonus in women with severe preeclampsia. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes.

CD007539,No studies have compared pre-medication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine with the effectiveness of ant-histamines in preventing transfusion reactions. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing active drug with placebo or other anti-histamines. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to compare active drug with alternative ant-histamines such as Benadryl or hydrocortisone.
CD007550,"We found no clear evidence to support routine antiep drug therapy of peripheral nociceptive barrage after tissue injury. However, this could easily have been missed with the small sample sizes in the two eligible studies. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to determine whether S(+)- isomer of ibuprofen is effective in preventing acute pain and suppression of plasma beta-endorphin levels in the oral surgery model of acute pain."
CD007557,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between heparin and unfractionated heparin for the outcomes examined in this review. The results suggest that heparin may be safer than unfractionated heparin because it induces HIT-antibody seroconversion, and the corresponding risk of HIT, less frequently."
CD007570,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between PEG 3350 and lactulose for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD007583,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of pelvic irradiation on cancer mortality in women with Stage IB cervical cancer. The results suggest that pelvic irradiation may improve survival in women with Stage IB cervical cancer when compared with no intervention or radical surgery.
CD007584,"We found no clear evidence to support routine colon cancer chemotherapy with platinum-containing regimens. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of second-look laparotomy in these patients."

CD007624,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two groups for the outcomes examined in this review. There is no apparent difference between the two groups for the outcomes examined in this review. The results do not apply to absence or myoclonus. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD007629,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of ischemic preconditioning on post-operative complications from hepatic resection. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of ischemic preconditioning compared with control groups or other ischemic preconditioning procedures."
CD007632,No studies have compared ischemic preconditioning with the benefits of intermittent portal triad clamping. There is only limited evidence to suggest use of perioperative ischemic clamping is effective in reducing operative blood loss and producing less ischemic injury. Certain people tend to have a lower postoperative mortality when compared with no intervention or other intervention. This could be because they are more easily confused with other interventions such as perioperative ischemia or blood transfusion.
CD007635,There is little evidence to suggest that a progressive resisted perioperative care leads to a shorter hospital stay or a quicker return to bowel movements.
CD007641,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of ""Eat Well with CF"" in reducing body mass index and improving quality of life measures in adults with cystic fibrosis. The results suggest that progressive resisted exercise may improve muscle strength in affected muscles."

No evidence was found comparing entacapone with other anticonvulsants such as dopamine agonists or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Further larger and longer-term trials are required to compare entacapone with other anticonvulsants such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
CD007675,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the outcomes of a Web-based weight loss program and those of a traditional intervention. The results suggest that the initial benefits of Web-based weight loss are more pronounced in people who are obese.
CD007679,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of laser in situ keratomileusis with the aim of correcting myopia. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of perioperative laser in situ keratomileusis, although evidence is lacking."
CD007749,"We have previously reported on the benefits of vitamin E supplementation for the reduction of fatigue scores in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing antioxidant supplementation with other nutrients such as vitamins A-E, biotin, selenium, zinc, manganese, copper, magnesium, folic acid and Coenzyme Q. The results suggest that vitamin E may improve the aminotransferase status of patients with hepatitis C when it is combined with other antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and vitamin E. However, this could be because the antioxidant drugs"
CD007775,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of buprenorphine on retention in treatment of opium-dependent patients. The results suggest that buprenorphine may be effective in preventing opioid dependence.
CD007815,"There is little information on the effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotics in reducing cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia.

CD007990,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral antidepressants in reducing tics in children with ADHD and Tourette's syndrome. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of oral antidepressants in reducing tics in children with ADHD and Tourette's syndrome."
CD008007,We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in PSA levels was achieved with the help of lycopene. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing lycopene with other antioxidant supplements.
CD008016,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two trials onsite. The two trials were greatly underpowered to detect uncommon adverse effects such as pyloric stenosis.
CD008037,"We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in respiratory tract infections/deaths/deaths when patients with CF are treated with oral beta-carotene. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of oral beta-carotene in reducing infections in patients with CF."
CD008054,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between human papillomavirus testing and the use of PCR for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) when both are used together. The results suggest that human papillomavirus testing is more effective than PCR in detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions but that the two are not interchangeable. This could be because they are differentiating between them.
CD008084,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral pulse therapy with glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide in the treatment of patients with severe paraquat poisoning. The results suggest that pulse therapy with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide may reduce the mortality rate for patients with severe paraquat poisoning.

CD008320,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between oral and oral drug treatment of pruritus. The results suggest that the two are intertwined. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of topical and systemic treatments, because data reported in the trials are scarce."
CD008326,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of total disc replacement compared to anterior interbody fusion in the treatment of low back pain. The results suggest that progressive disc degeneration is more effective than fusion in reducing pain.
CD008366,"The aim of this study was to investigate the net effect of a cardiovascular disease-prevention program (Hartslag Limburg) on lifestyle factors after 5 years of intervention (1998-2003). In a cohort study, 5-year mean changes in lifestyle factors (energy intake; fat intake; time spent on leisure-time physical activity; walking, bicycling, and sports; and smoking behavior) were compared for men and women and for those with a low (less than intermediate secondary education) and a moderate (intermediate vocational or higher secondary education) or high (higher vocational education or university) educational level. Adjustments were made"

CD008392,"We have not found evidence that a significant reduction in pain was achieved when patients were treated with pre-emptive analgesics instead of post-operative analgesics. The results suggest that ibuprofen administered pre-emptly may reduce post-operative pain when compared with acetaminophen. However, a true benefit could easily have been missed with the small sample sizes in the two eligible studies. The studies were greatly underpowered to detect uncommon adverse effects such as dysphonia. Additional controlled trials are required to determine whether pre-emptive analgesics are effective or not in preventing post-operative pain."

CD008739,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of weekly fluconazole prophylaxis of vaginal candidiasis in women with HIV infection. The results suggest that weekly fluconazole is effective in preventing oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis but not esophageal candidiasis. This could be because the drug inhibits Candida albicans from migrating.
CD008896,"There is little evidence to suggest that the introduction of family planning counseling into the routine family planning care of women has a significant impact on contraceptive use or on subsequent pregnancy rates. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes.
