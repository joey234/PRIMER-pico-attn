CD000020,"The ""control"" group were used as controls at the 28th and 34th weeks of pregnancy, while the "" group received two injections of anti-D immunoglobulin given on the same dates after taking the necessary tests. Immunological testing at the time of the delivery and after the delivery showed that 7 women had become positive for positive Rh D immunoglobulin in the ""control"" group whereas only one in the ""treated"" group. This difference, which is statistically significant, confirms the results of other authors about the efficiency of antepartum rhesus disease prevention. The"
CD000025,There was no difference in the rate of administration of magnesium sulfate compared to placebo or to either magnesium sulfate or to no treatment at all in the groups of women randomlyised to receive either magnesium sulfate or to receive no treatment at all. The use of magnesium sulfate to evaluate the level of benefit of magnesium sulfate for the prevention of eclampsia in women with severe preeclampsia was less effective than the use of magnesium sulfate for the prevention of eclampsia in women with severe preeclampsia.
CD000036,"The control group showed similar figures: 16.66% esarean sections with 77.7% of them done for fetal distress. We observed an incidence of 20.45% of acute fetal distress in the study group against 12.96% in the control group. Such a difference is not statistically significant. The group under study demonstrated a rate of 6.82% pathological pH value in the igenic umarilical departments of the hospital while the rate of abnormally high values was 18.52%. In both groups, the greatest groin percentage of acidotic pH was observed in"

CD000126,"There was no significant difference in the rate of death or hospitalisation for patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy compared to general anaesthesia. The incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with carotid endarterectomy was less than that in the general population. However, there was a significant increase in the rate of hospitalisation for people undergoing carotid endarterectomy. This was due to the high rate of administration of local anaesthetic, the small number of participants in the randomised trials, and the short follow-up. No significant differences were found in the rate of"
CD000148,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the treatment of placental insufficiency, carnitine may have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit. In the control group, carnitine did not have a significant effect on the disease activity. In the group of the treated patients 11 out of 15 showed an improvement, in 4 patients no effect of carnitine was seen and in 1 patient the retardation increased. In the control group 8 out of 15 patients showed a spontaneous systemic improvement of progressive fetal growth."

CD000328,"There is no evidence to suggest that HFJV is effective in reducing the incidence of pulmonary complications, mortality, or morbidity in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome. It is possible that it may be effective in reducing the incidence of these outcomes. However, there is no evidence to suggest that it is effective in reducing the incidence of pulmonary complications, mortality, or morbidity in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome."
CD000332,There was no evidence from the two studies comparing r-HuEPO with placebo that a significant difference was seen in the rate of response to treatment with r-HuEPO. This is based on medium-term evidence. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow the current treatment policies of rheumatoid arthritis.
CD000353,"There has been no rigorous investigation into this form of treatment for asthma. In a randomised, double blind, controlled trial the effects of individualised homeopathic remedies were compared with medication in 96 children with mild to moderate asthma as an adjunct to conventional treatment. The main outcome measure was the active quality of living subscale of the Childhood Asthma Questionnaire.

There is no evidence of the effectiveness of quinine compared with other antimalarial drugs in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria."
CD000566,"There is still controversy over whether or not patients should be hyperventilated after traumatic brain injury, and a randomized trial has never been conducted. The theoretical advantages of hyperventilation robust are cerebral vasoconstriction for intracranial pressure (ICP) control and reversal of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acidosis. Possible disadvantages include cerebral vasoconstriction to such an extent that cerebral ischemia ensues, and only a short-lived effect on F with a loss of HCO3-buffer from CSF. The latter disadvantage might be overcome by the addition of"
CD000954,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in patients with primary Raynaud's Phenomenon, ketanserin is associated with statistically significant reductions in important short-term adverse outcomes. However, the long-term safety data on the use of ketanserin in this manner is unknown."
CD000968,"After 18 sessions, reassessment with the CPT showed that patients in the experimental group made significantly more improvement than the control group, which made no significant change. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale assessments before and after the study phase indicated that both groups improved on the total score but the experimental group made significantly more improvement. These results suggest that it is feasible to use practice and remediate a core attention deficit in chronic schizophrenia.Modifiability of cognitive function in people with schizophrenia is important for future clinical trials."

CD001054,"There is increasing evidence that people with early-term disability are more likely to be diagnosed with a serious lower-quality disability, and that interventions designed to reduce this may be effective in preventing disability. However, there is insufficient evidence that these interventions are effective in preventing falls. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality to determine whether interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls are effective in preventing these."
CD001076,There is some indication that small infants with oxygen deprivation may be more likely to respond to supplemental oxygen than those with no supplemental oxygen use or those on medication that reduces the risk of such events. This conclusion is limited by small infants being on very small amounts of supplementary oxygen or those on medication that reduces the risk of such events.

CD001321,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of cranberry juice for the prevention of urinary tract infections in people with spinal cord injury. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001327,"This multi- site trial will evaluate whether use of an antibiotic prior to insertion reduces the risk of UD removal for all medical reasons, including upper genital tract infection. It is believed that much of the small increased risk for developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) associated with the use of an �� two-ferabyte intrauterine device ( IUD) appears to be caused by bacterial contamination of the endometrial cavity at the time of insertion. Previous research suggests that use of prophylactic antibiotics immediately prior to IUD insertion may reduce the risk of developing PID."
CD001333,"We found no clear differences between naltrexone and placebo in the rate of relapse, duration of treatment, participants' satisfaction with treatment, and their perception of drug use. However, there was a 10% and 42% reduction for participants on naltrexone compared to placebo, respectively, which was not statistically significant. These results suggest that naltrexone may be a useful adjunct to other antiepileptics in the treatment of opioid dependence. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of relapse, duration of treatment, participants' satisfaction with treatment, or their perception of drug use."

CD001401,"There was no significant difference in the rate of improvement of pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to patients with non-CF lung disease. The most common side-effect with all regimens was unpredictable vaginal bleeding. This was due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment, and the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Results from the randomised controlled trials comparing PEP with other means of chest physiotherapy were inconsistent across the studies, ranging from highly effective to not effective. The most common side-effect with all regimens was"

Although the use of a manual chest percussion treatment is not effective in preventing acute pulmonary exacerbation, it may be advisable in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis with a respiratory tract CPT. Results from the trial of manual chest percussion in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis in patients with cystic fibrosis were inconsistent across studies, ranging from highly effective to not effective, implying that the use of a"
CD002038,"The NIAID Clinical Trials Group has conducted a meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials comparing zidovudine with other antiretroviral therapies and with didanosine alone. The results suggest that zidovudine alone may be effective in preventing the progression of HIV-1 infection in people with early-stage disease, but that it should be interpreted with caution. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of zidovudine in the context of existing therapy."

CD003064,"The effect of frusemide on the course of transient tachypnoea of the newborn was evaluated in a controlled, prospective study. There was no significant difference in the time to hospital discharge or the duration of hospitalisation for groups of infants with transient tachypnoea. Outcomes assessed included duration of supplemental oxygen requirement, the period of tachypnoea and the time to hospital discharge. A single dose of intravenous fountain frusemide (2 mg/kg) does not improve the clinical course of transient tachypnea. This finding suggests that either rotten"
CD003076,"There was no clear evidence from the two studies comparing low-molecular-weight heparin with standard heparin that it was effective in the treatment of proximal deep-vein thrombosis. The results of the review did not change based on the outcome data.

The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. D-cycloserine is a partial agonist on the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor. This double-blind crossover study of 15 mg D-cycloserine in Alzheimer's disease patients did not demonstrate clinical benefit. Higher medication dosage or long-term treatment may be required.
CD003161,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of cognitive-behavioral therapy for late-life insomnia. This review provides evidence that in a small study of four people with late-life insomnia, cognitive-behavioral therapy was more effective than placebo in improving time-to-awoken-ness and improving sleep-related quality of life. Results from the review showed that there was a statistically significant difference in time to awake for people with late-life insomnia when cognitive-behavioral therapy was compared with no intervention or placebo."
CD003175,"There was no statistically significant difference in progression or progression-free interval between patients with high-risk endometrial cancer and those with low-risk endometrial cancer. The endometrial cancer mortality rate in high-risk endometrial cancer was not significantly increased compared to control groups despite the continuation of high-risk endometrial cancer. This may be because of the small number of participants in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment, the lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures, and the small number of participants in the two studies. Nevertheless, it seems desirable to conduct large randomized trials that would include"

CD004334,"Despite the proven safety value of wearing vehicle safety restraints, people continue to travel without this protection. Legislation requiring the use of safety �� restraint s has been implemented in several countries, including Australia, in an attempt to improve rates of restraint use. In Australia, legislation dramatically increased rates of adult restraint use, yet the rate of restraint use by children remains comparatively low. One of the main reasons for parents not restraining their child is the child's dislike of wearing a restraint, with resultant disruptive behavior. This study compared two interventions implemented within preschools: a coercive intervention aimed at parents and an educational intervention aimed at preschool children."

CD009215,"There were no significant differences for the following outcomes: caesarean section (relative risk] 0.70-1.41), ventouse (RR 1.5, 95% CI: 0.31-7.62), frankfurter intervention (RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.75-1.3) and second-stage augmentation (RR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.82-1.7). Significantly more babies born to control participants were transferred to NICU 0 versus 6 (2%), P = 0.017."
CD009217,"The long-term effects of non-pharmacologic interventions on cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported in a few studies, but no significant studies were available for the effects of potassium-enriched salt. The review identified six randomized controlled trials, three of which showed a significant benefit for potassium-enriched salt, one of which showed a significant benefit for sodium, and one of which showed a significant benefit for both. All studies showed significant benefit for potassium-enriched salt in the short term."
CD009337,"Venue-based surveys were conducted shortly after the campaign began and 6 months later to assess changes in exposure to campaign materials, knowledge about syphilis, perceptions of risk, sexual behavior, clinic visits, and testing and treatment for syphilis. No significant increases in knowledge, clinic visits, or treatment for syphilis among participants were detected over the 6-month study period. The results suggest that including detailed information about accessing testing services may be a vital ingredient in the success of media campaigns focusing on HIV testing."
CD009401,There is evidence from one trial that a systematic review of interventions providing information about the benefit of postoperative pain management improves practice. This review provides evidence that a systematic review of interventions providing information about the benefit of postoperative pain management improves practice.
CD009411,"There is no high-quality evidence that high-dose chemotherapy increases the rate of relapse of Hodgkin's disease, and further research is needed to confirm this."
CD009414,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of any interventions for preventing the incidence of intimate partner violence in pregnancy. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD009497,A new approach-derived free radicals was assessed in a prospective randomized controlled double-blind trial using the radical scavengers dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and allopurinol. Following palliative more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of this technique and the optimal dose and frequency of administration.
CD009510,"There was a 10% and 42% reduction in the mean CFT at month 12 of ranibizumab treatment in patients with BRVO compared to placebo, respectively. The mean reduction in the CFT at month 12 of ranibizumab was less than that in the placebo group and was comparable to that in both."
CD009607,There was no significant difference in the rate of improvement in VE at the end of the intervention or at the end of the study for VTh in children with asthma. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed studies in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the effects of exercise on VTh in children with asthma.
CD009662,A single endoscopist performed ERCP in 400 consecutive patients with pancreatic duct �epicrosis without intervention was able to reduce the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis by a significant margin. This was based on a randomised controlled trial of high methodological rigour. There was no significant difference in the primary success rate for WGC in the HGW group compared to the standard method. The primary success rate was higher in the HGW (81.4 %) than in the standard catheter group (53.9 %; P < 0.001). The aphro
CD009779,There is no evidence to suggest that endoscopic endoscopic pancreatitis treatment is effective or not effective in preventing acute pancreatitis. This review provides evidence that endoscopic pancreatitis treatment is not effective or not effective in preventing acute pancreatitis. There is no evidence to suggest that endoscopic pancreatitis treatment is effective or not effective in preventing acute pancreatitis.
CD009882,"The primary end point was the reduced-risk reduction in annualized relapse rate (RRR) for erythropoietic growth factors (for all regimens) in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) who were receiving erythropoietic growth factors, but not erythropoietic growth factors. The lower- risk reduction in annualized relapse rate (for all regimens) for erythropoietic growth factors (for all regimens) in patients with RMS who were receiving erythropoietic growth factors is less significant than the absence of any adverse"
CD010119,"There is increasing evidence that family planning may be a useful adjunct to HIV testing in developing countries. This review provides evidence that in the case of Rwanda, family planning may be a useful adjunct to HIV testing in terms of practice and quality of life. We found that family planning may be a useful adjunct to HIV testing in terms of practice and quality of life."
CD010155,We studied one trial that showed a significant benefit from the use of tinzaparin for patients with acute crisis of SCA. The beneficial effects of tinzaparin for patients with acute crisis of SCA were statistically significant and were statistically significant for a mean of three weeks. The beneficial effects of tinzaparin for patients with acute crisis of SCA were statistically significant and were associated with a mean of three weeks.
CD010245,This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the use of tranexamic acid in erythrocyte transfusion after hip fracture surgery.
CD010424,There was no significant difference in the pain scores of patients with and without peritoneal closure in the two groups. This review provides evidence that there is no statistically significant difference in the pain scores of patients with and without peritoneal closure in the two groups.
CD010609,"There is no evidence of effect of gabapentin in the treatment of migraine. There is a small evidence of benefit of gabapentin in the treatment of migraine in adults. However, there is insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of gabapentin in the treatment of migraine in children. The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression."
