CD000019,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone for prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences. In preterm infants at risk for lung disease, corticosteroids alone reduces the risk of RDS, and in certain situations it may improve survival. However, there is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids alone for this purpose. In the absence of evidence to support the use of corticosteroids alone, women should be offered entry into a randomised trial."
CD000020,"There is evidence from one trial that antepartum treatment of rhesus D reduces the risk of alloimmunization, which may be useful in preventing the disease. There is no evidence that the use of anti-D Ig has prevented rhesus D disease. It is possible that the lack of beneficial effects of anti-D Ig may have prevented the disease."
CD000025,"There is no evidence of effect of magnesium sulfate on length of labour or in the prevention of seizures in women with hypertension. There is a risk of hot flushes and other adverse effects, but these are not significant in women with magnesium sulfate."
CD000036,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of ritodrine for the treatment of intrauterine fetal growth retardation. [Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
CD000052,"Compared to nebulization, the use of a spacer device is more effective in terms of lower costs and better quality of treatment than albuterol. The use of a non-valved device for treatment of acute asthma is less effective than the use of a nebulizer. The use of a non-valved device for treatment of acute asthma is more effective than the use of a nebulizer in terms of lower costs and better quality of treatment than the use of a spacer."
CD000088,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that family interventions are significantly effective in reducing relapse and re-hospitalisation among patients with schizophrenia."
CD000093,There is no evidence of effect of the gamma nail on functional outcomes compared to the Ambi hip screw or the centrifugal screw. There is a risk of intraoperative blood loss and a higher rate of wound complications in the patients treated with the gamma nail. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of the intramedullary device for fixation of peritrochanteric fractures of the hip.
CD000126,"General anaesthesia is more effective than local anaesthesia in reducing the risk of peroperative hypertension and post-operative hypotension. However, there is a 10% higher risk of stroke and a 10% higher risk of myocardial ischemia when performed under general anaesthesia. This may explain why there is a 10% and 10% increase in peroperative hypertension and post-operative hypotension in the two groups of CEA procedures."
CD000148,"Carnitine substitution treatment for placental insufficiency is not effective, and the results suggest that the money spent on the treatment of placental insufficiency is likely to be in vain. There is no evidence to suggest that the additional supply of glucose or galactose does not improve the therapeutic effect of FGR. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies and the heterogeneity of the assessment."
CD000164,"Antenatal phenobarbital appears to be effective in reducing the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in preterm infants. The incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (grades 3 and 4) was significantly less in the phenobarbital-treated infants (22% versus 35%) than in the control group (35% versus 42%). There was no evidence for or against other lines of treatment of preterm infants, but this does not exclude the possible benefits of other lines of treatment such as antenatal vitamin K or other antenatal drugs."
CD000165,"The previous version of this review showed that a small number of interventions were effective in reducing the risk of smoking, and this updated review provides evidence that the intervention design and testing is more effective."
CD000187,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of anticoagulation in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies and the small number of participants in the anticoagulation. Nevertheless, these data suggest a benefit of oral anticoagulation over oral medication for patients with NRAF who are taking both."
CD000201,"Oxytocin when used as a prophylactic administration is associated with a lower risk of postpartum haemorrhage than Syntometrine. However, the use of ergometrine is associated with a higher incidence of nausea, vomiting and headache. Further research is needed to determine if these effects are attributable to different doses of oxytocin and to determine the optimal dose of oxytocin."
CD000212,"Compared to placebo, auranofin showed a small advantage for pain, but not significant for other outcomes. Further well designed trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and effectiveness of auranofin in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis."
CD000277,"Magnesium sulfate therapy may reduce the risk of cerebral ischemia and may reduce the risk of death in patients with aneurysm rupture. However, the data on did not exclude the possibility that the drug may increase the risk of serious adverse events, such as pyloric stenosis. The data on did not exclude the possibility that the drug may increase the risk of serious adverse events, such as pyloric stenosis."
CD000301,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from corticosteroids in patients with Crohn's disease. However, it is quite possible that the lack of beneficial effects of corticosteroids in this setting may have a adverse effect on the disease. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of corticosteroids in Crohn's."
CD000313,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that case management of patients with congestive heart failure is effective in reducing hospital stay and reducing emergency department visits."
CD000328,There is no evidence to suggest that the use of HFJV/OPT in the treatment of RDS is effective or not effective. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD000332,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of erythropoietin for treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with RA. The beneficial effects of erythropoietin for treating anemia of chronic disease are not clear from the limited evidence available. Adverse effects are generally minor and transient. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of erythropoietin for treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with RA.
CD000353,"There is some indication that homeopathy may be effective for treating asthma in children. However, there is no evidence of a clinically relevant or statistically significant effect on the quality of life of children with asthma. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field."
CD000361,"No evidence is available using prophylactic administration of immune globulin is effective for preventing nosocomial infection. The use of IVIG for preterm infants is not effective, despite the availability of other treatments. No evidence is available using prophylactic administration of immune globulin is effective for preventing nosocomial infection."
CD000387,"There is evidence from one trial that disclosure results in a significant reduction in pain, and there is evidence that it may improve sexual functioning in women with chronic pelvic pain. There is no evidence that the use of disclosure for chronic abdominal pain is effective."
CD000391,"Methotrexate appears to be beneficial for patients with severe asthma without increasing the risk of adverse effects. In a review of the current evidence, authors found no evidence of benefit from low-dose methotrexate in reducing the use of corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma."
CD000407,Corticosteroids are used for treating pulmonary disease in patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis. The beneficial effects of corticosteroids on lung function are not clear from data on prednisone. There is no clear evidence from the corticosteroids data on their own.
CD000412,"Use of combined exogenous gonadotropins and pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian disease is effective in terms of Ovulation and pregnancy rates. However, there is a high rate of premature luteinization that may be associated with the use of this approach. In view of the modest number of patients included in the review, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously."
CD000424,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of bromocriptine for the treatment of chronic non-fluent aphasia. The beneficial effects of bromocriptine for aphasia are not clear from the evidence available. Based on the current evidence, bromocriptine is not effective as a treatment for aphasia."
CD000459,We found no clear evidence to support the use of atypical antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of atypical antipsychotics.
CD000498,"There is no high quality evidence that intraventricular streptokinase treatment reduces the need for shunt surgery in post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. There is a risk of re-bleeding, ventriculitis or meningitis from the use of intraventricular streptokinase. Further high quality evidence is required to support the routine use of intraventricular streptokinase for the treatment of post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus."
CD000503,We found no clear evidence regarding the effect of fluid restriction on mortality and morbidity in low-birth-weight infants. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any adverse effects from large fluid intakes in the first weeks of life.
CD000527,"Compared to quinine, artemether and its derivatives had similar clinical and laboratory data. There was no significant difference in the time taken to clear 50% of parasites or in the rate of survival in patients treated with artemether. There were however, some patients who died from complications of treatment with quinine, which may have implications in the treatment of severe malaria."
CD000566,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of hyperventilation in patients with severe head injury. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless, it is desirable to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials that would include endpoints that show the effects of hyperventilation in patients with severe head injury."
CD000954,No evidence is available using serotonin receptor antagonists in patients with systemic sclerosis is effective.
CD000968,"We found some limited evidence of use of attention training in schizophrenia. This review does not cover the full benefit of attention training in schizophrenia. However, it suggests that it is possible to use practice and behavioral learning to remediate a core attention deficit in chronic schizophrenia."
CD001021,No evidence is available using gentamicin as a treatment for cystic fibrosis. There is a risk of ototoxicity. There is no evidence of benefit from inhaled tobramycin in patients with mild lung disease. There is no evidence of benefit from inhaled tobramycin in patients with chronic P. aeruginosa.
CD001035,"The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and carers already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. In addition to providing information about HIV, condoms and risk of infection, these interventions can be used to enhance people's already-existing condom use and to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases."
CD001054,There is little evidence to suggest that the use of preventive home visits by public health nurses can reduce the risk of fractures in people aged 70 and over. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001076,Response of small premature infants to restriction of supplementary oxygen.
CD001088,"Treatment for people with severe mental illness and substance use disorders should be offered in different approaches, with careful attention given to study design."
CD001108,"Adding antifungal drugs to treatment of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis reduces inflammation of the airway, and may reduce the risk of serious adverse events. The use of itraconazole may be justified in the treatment of patients with chronic asthma if further evidence is established."
CD001125,"cyproterone acetate (CPA) and flutamide (250 mg daily) appear to be similar in effectiveness to cyproterone acetate (CPA) when used in conjunction with an oral contraceptive. The other antiandrogenics, including finasteride and CPA, did not show a significant effect on hirsutism. There was a small increase in the number of women with hirsutism when treated with antiandrogenics, but this was not significant. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of antiandrogenics in the treatment of hirsutism"
CD001158,"Prednisone may be beneficial for patients with RA when used as a second-line treatment. However, the long-term data on the effect of prednisone on bone mass and disease activity in RA is not clear."
CD001177,There is insufficient evidence to assess the safety or effectiveness of the use of topical anaesthetic cream for the debridement of venous leg ulcers. The use of topical anaesthetic cream for the cleansing of venous leg ulcers is safe and effective.
CD001181,"[Antibiotic prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery: a comparison of oral and systemic antibiotics?] In a prospective randomized trial of high methodological rigour, participants were asked to provide evidence about their experiences with antibiotic prophylaxis. We found that the following antibiotics were associated with a lower incidence of infection than oral antibiotics or other antibiotics, but were not associated with an increase in overall mortality. This could be because the antibiotics were more associated with higher adverse outcomes. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, because data reported in the"
CD001190,"donepezil appears to be beneficial for patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, and in the rate of progression of disability in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease. However, there was no evidence for or against other cholinesterase inhibitors. The available evidence is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of donepezil in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
CD001211,"Most patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis do not need treatment with an antibiotic. The proportion of patients who had all organisms eradicated, including the coagulase-negative staphylococci, after two to three days treatment was 52.7% for the treatment and 41% for the placebo. In culture-confirmed patients, the treatment effect tends to be strong (adjusted risk difference = 23% [95% CI = -6 to 42]) but there is no evidence of a significant effect for non-culture-negative staphylococci."
CD001216,The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. There is a case for large scale implementation of faecal occult blood testing for colorectal cancer.
CD001230,There is evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy can reduce the risk of HIV infection in people with HIV. This review does not cover the specific outcomes of the intervention. There is no evidence that the cognitive behaviour therapy offered in this review reduces the risk of HIV infection in people with HIV.
CD001242,No evidence is available using dopamine or dobutamine in the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants. There is a limited evidence using dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in improving MAP and in reducing intestinal perfusion. These data do not support the continued use of dobutamine in the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants.
CD001247,"Early treatment of acute ischemic stroke with hypothermia is effective in reducing neuronal damage and in preventing a poor outcome. However, there is insufficient evidence to support a role for antipyretic treatment of acute ischemic stroke. In addition, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of early ischemic stroke in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated."
CD001257,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid as a treatment for schizophrenia. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001263,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that a four-drug regimen is effective for the treatment of acute melioidosis."
CD001281,"In addition to inhaled corticosteroids, patients with nocturnal asthma can be treated with oral theophylline. Theophylline may have similar effects to salmeterol in terms of improved lung function, fewer nocturnal awakenings and improved sleep quality. However, recent studies have demonstrated that theophylline may delay sleep onset and perturb sleep stage distribution. This could have implications for long-term treatment of nocturnal asthma."
CD001301,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of ICSI for the treatment of non-male-factor infertility. There is limited evidence to support the use of ICSI in the treatment of infertility in adults.
CD001321,"Cranberry extract may reduce the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI) in people with neurogenic bladder and in people with pelvic radiotherapy. However, there was no evidence from the trials on the period after cranberry extract had finished and no information about the long-term effects of this treatment was given. Conversely, cranberry concentrate may increase the risk of bacterial and yeast infections. There were no clear effects from the use of cranberry extract on long-term health status or mortality in people with neurogenic bladder or in people with pelvic radiotherapy."
CD001327,"Use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to the insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) reduces the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and may reduce the frequency of unplanned IUD removal. However, the results of this review are not significant due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics before insertion of intrauterine devices."
CD001333,"Naltrexone appears to be beneficial for heroin dependence. In patients with a high risk of relapse, naltrexone appears to be associated with a lower rate of use of opioid than placebo. In patients with a low risk of HIV, naltrexone appears to be associated with fewer side effects than placebo. However, there was no evidence from the trials on the period after treatment had finished and no information about the long-term effects of naltrexone in heroin dependence was given."
CD001356,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of surgical treatment of knee injuries. When used in the context of sports, the results are not always significant. However, when used in the context of chronic pain, the results are more likely to be positive."
CD001366,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the absence of evidence of a significant effect of dietary advice on lipid levels, it is not possible to recommend a specific type of intervention. The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the absence of evidence of a significant effect of dietary advice on lipid levels, it is not possible to recommend a specific type of intervention."
CD001401,There is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of chest physiotherapy on lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis. The results suggest that progressive resisted physiotherapy may be effective in improving lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis.
CD001466,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials for the evaluation and prediction of the effect of therapy in spondylotic cervical myelopathy. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD001471,There is no definitive evidence to support the use of games to teach people about psychiatric disorders.
CD001496,"There is evidence that systemic corticosteroids can improve symptoms of non-allergic pulmonary disease. However, there is insufficient evidence for or against systemic corticosteroids. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD001531,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific training methods to improve the safety knowledge of children. However, it is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up the randomised trials or other quasi-experimental designs needed to produce evidence for the effectiveness of training programs."
CD001545,We have not found evidence that a significant benefit exists from the use of palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. The results of this review confirm that palliative chemotherapy may prolong survival and improve quality of life in patients with advanced gastric and colorectal cancer.
CD001546,"Although the benefits of laparoscopic appendectomy are clear, the effectiveness and effectiveness of this method of surgery are not. It is possible that the low mortality from appendectomy is a false negative result due to the high incidence of wrong diagnosis. With limited data on other outcomes, laparoscopic appendectomy may be associated with higher postoperative pain, and may increase the risk of wound infection."
CD001552,There is unclear evidence from the review that surgery results in a greater symptomatic improvement than steroid injection. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing treatments of different effectiveness in patients with CTS.
CD001704,No evidence is available using exercise as a form of rehabilitation in elderly people after hip fracture.
CD001706,"Total hip replacement results in the least pain and most mobility at 1 year, while hemiarthroplasty is worst in these respects. The most significant complication was dislocation, which occurred in 7 patients with THR and 2 with UHR-C. The mortality rate at 2 years was 18%; all but two of the deaths were in patients with one of five different medical diseases: clinically significant cardiac or pulmonary disease, cancer, alcoholism or psychosis. The range of passive hip motion in the three groups of patients did not differ significantly (p>0.05)."
CD001707,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of hemiarthroplasty for patients with displaced subcapital fracture of the femur. There is a risk of perioperative complications in all groups of patients.
CD001708,The four-year functional result after a displaced subcapital hip fracture is affected by the type of surgery. There is no evidence of effect of external fixation on the outcome of hip replacement.
CD001717,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of clopenthixol decanoate as a treatment for schizophrenia. When used as a depot medication, it may have similar effects to perphenazine enanthate. When used as a treatment for autistic behaviour, clopenthixol decanoate may have similar effects to fluspirilene. The beneficial effects of clopenthixol decanoate must be evaluated in blinded trials against other depot neuroleptics."
CD001724,No evidence is available using bio-resorbable membrane treatments in the treatment of intrabony defects.
CD001728,There is no evidence of effect of steam inhalation on the symptoms of the common cold. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of nasal inhalation in treating experimental RV colds.
CD001746,The previous version of this review showed that interventions to reduce the exposure of children to tobacco smoke in the home were effective. This updated review provides evidence that the intervention design and testing activity was effective in reducing the exposure of children to tobacco smoke.
CD001777,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of IUDs inserted immediately after the termination of pregnancy. IUDs inserted immediately after abortion may be more effective than devices that are not included in the trial. However, there is no evidence that the rate of expulsion or displacement of IUDs into the lower uterine segment is different between IUDs that are not included in the trial."
CD001829,"Topical bleomycin may be effective for the treatment of oral leukoplakia. However, there is no evidence of effect from the use of topical bleomycin in long-term treatment. There is a risk of side-effects from the use of topical bleomycin, which may be reasons for caution."
CD001843,"Urinary incontinence is one of the main complications of radical prostatectomy. Most men with prostate surgery are not willing to attend support groups that focus on solving problems, but a small number (few) of participants in this review were willing to attend. This may explain why there is limited evidence for an effect of support groups on continence."
CD001863,"There is evidence that postnatal home visits are associated with a reduction in the frequency of second births and a increase in the use of contraception. However, there is no evidence that the home visits increase the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. There is evidence that the home visits increase the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes but there is no evidence that the home visits increase the use of contraception."
CD001867,"There is evidence that naltrexone is effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence. When used in conjunction with psychosocial therapies, naltrexone reduces the number of drinking days, heavy drinking, and time to relapse to alcohol use in alcohol-dependent individuals."
CD001871,School-based interventions are effective in reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity.
CD001877,The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. There is a evidence of a reduction in the risk of breast cancer death and mortality when women are offered annual invitation to mammography.
CD001888,There is evidence that post-operative autotransfusion of shed blood reduces the need for homologous blood transfusion and may reduce the risk of infection. There is no evidence that the use of post-operative autotransfusion of shed blood reduces the risk of allogeneic blood transfusion and may reduce the risk of infection. There is evidence that the use of post-operative autotransfusion of shed blood reduces the risk of allogeneic blood transfusion and may reduce the risk of infection.
CD001903,"The ketogenic diet is effective in reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life in people with refractory epilepsy. It is safe to say that most of the studies were of low methodological quality and small sample sizes. There is no high quality evidence that the diet reduces seizure frequency or that it reduces seizure frequency at a clinically meaningful level. Large multi-centre RCTs of the ketogenic diet are needed, with careful attention given to study design."
CD001914,"Use of dietary supplements is associated with a small change in body mass index centile. However, this is not a significant change and dietary supplements are not an effective means of improving nutritional status in children with CF. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary supplements in improving nutritional status in children with CF."
CD001929,"Although the value of popular forms of alternative care for chronic low back pain is unclear, one study suggests that acupressure may be an effective adjunct to medical care for people with LBP. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of acupressure compared to other therapies, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not acupressure has an anti-inflammatory effect."
CD001950,"There is limited evidence to suggest the effectiveness of clonazepam for the treatment of akathisia. In older adolescents and young adults, clonazepam may be effective at reducing akathisia scores at the end of the first treatment week than placebo. However, there is limited evidence to support the use of clonazepam for the treatment of akathisia."
CD001951,"Higher doses of haloperidol (≥ 10 mg/day) appear to be equally effective as low doses (≥ 5.5 mg/day) in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. However, there is no evidence of effect at the high dose (≥ 10.5 mg/day) and no evidence of harm at the low dose (≥ 5.5 mg/day). The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the studies and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of haloperidol compared"
CD001972,"Oral candidiasis may be improved with the use of antifungal drugs that are more effective than oral candidiasis without increasing the risk of side effects. However, most of the studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed."
CD002011,"Compared to CPT, HFCC appears to be similar in effectiveness and safety to CPT. In patients with acute pulmonary exacerbation, CPT appears to be similar to HFCC in terms of improved clinical status, pulmonary function, and clinical outcomes. In patients with CF who are hospitalised for an acute exacerbation, CPT appears to be similar to HFCC in terms of effectiveness and safety."
CD002038,"A single nucleoside therapy can improve survival and delays disease progression in patients with advanced HIV disease. The benefit of combination therapy is less significant than that of zidovudine alone. In patients with advanced HIV infection, combination therapy appears to be more effective than zidovudine therapy alone. In patients with asymptomatic HIV disease, combination therapy appears to be more effective than zidovudine alone. In patients with advanced HIV infection, combination therapy appears to be more effective than zidovudine alone."
CD002058,"Following administration of surfactant, preterm neonates with RDS and a birth weight of less than 1,200 g were included in this comparative observational pilot study when still mechanically ventilated and with an oxygen requirement on the third day of life. The patients (gestational age 26.1+/-0.9 weeks, birth weight 826+/-140 g, mean+/-SD) were alternately allocated to prophylactic treatment with inhaled beclomethasone (n = 7), or to early systemic dexamethasone therapy after day 10 of life, if clinically indicated (n = 9)."
CD002119,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of non-pharmacological interventions for women with primary dysmenorrhea. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies, the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes, and the small number of participants in the studies. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary studies is required to support the use of non-pharmacological interventions for women with primary dysmenorrhea."
CD002140,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that radiotherapy alone is superior to radiotherapy alone in improving survival in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer."
CD002170,We found no clear differences between DPI and MDI for the bronchodilating effects of salbutamol in patients with COPD. The beneficial effects of DPI and MDI for the bronchodilating effects of salbutamol are similar. Adequately powered trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of RMT compared to a conventional metered dose inhaler and to examine the relationship between RMT and a spacer device.
CD002192,No evidence is available using oral midazolam for day-case surgery is effective. There is a risk of sedation and sedation at the time of anaesthesia and after surgery. There is no prolongation of delayed recovery of cognitive function as a result of midazolam.
CD002232,"It is not clear that a difference exists between cefotaxime and cefotaxime for the rate of infection resolution and hospital survival in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In patients with cirrhosis, cefotaxime is more effective than cefotaxime in terms of infection resolution and length of treatment but not in terms of mortality."
CD002238,Nocturnal enuresis is a rare disease that may be improved with the use of pharmacotherapy. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. There is a requirement for a large scale RCT of oxybutynin to confirm the preliminary results from this review.
CD002248,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of psychological treatments for dysmenorrhea. Most of the studies are of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; further research is required.
CD002256,Higher rates of recurrent urinary tract infection and more serious adverse outcomes are associated with the use of cefuroxime. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field.
CD002261,"Pramipexole appears to be beneficial for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. There is no significant evidence for or against other dopamine agonists. The most common side-effect under pramipexole were fatigue, dyskinesia and vivid dreams. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with dementia there is no significant evidence for or against other dopamine agonists."
CD002279,The results of this review confirm the preliminary results of the first review. There is no evidence of effect of sealant or varnish on the rate of caries increment.
CD002744,"Oseltamivir appears to be effective for the prevention of influenza in children with asthma. When started within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, oseltamivir decreases the incidence of acute otitis media by 85% and reduces the time to resolution of illness by 3.5 days. In unvaccinated children and those with influenza A resistant to oseltamivir, the drug tends to be more effective than placebo. However, there is no evidence of effect of oseltamivir against influenza B. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define"
CD002751,The two studies included in this review provide evidence that there is no evidence of benefit from active compression-decompression CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. There is a limited number of studies that can be used to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of active compression-decompression CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
CD002759,"The benefits of resistance training on physical function are clear from evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of progressive exercise, because data reported in the trials are scarce."

CD002771,"There is evidence that KMC is effective in terms of weight gain, and in terms of reducing the incidence of serious disease. In infants with preterm weight, KMC may be more effective than CMC in terms of reducing mortality, and in terms of reducing lactation."
CD002778,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of oral splints for patients with myofascial pain. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required.
CD002787,"Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) appears to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there is no evidence of a effect of NO on mortality or length of stay in these patients. There is a risk of leak when inhaled NO is used, which may explain why there is limited evidence of a benefit of NO in this population."
CD002799,"There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies HCC. However, there is some indication that HCC screening may reduce HCC mortality. This evidence is not corroborative."
CD002829,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about the effectiveness of CoQ10 for ALS did not change. Given the lack of evidence from the previous trials, and the lack of evidence from the current trials, it is difficult to recommend a large scale trial of this type."
CD002830,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of haloperidol for the initial management of acutely agitated patients. When used in a double-blind trial, it may be advisable to use a more effective medication."
CD002863,The results of this review confirm that antihypertensive drugs are effective in preventing the development of hypertension in women with mild to moderate hypertension. There is no evidence of effect of antihypertensive drugs on the outcomes of the women or the newborn.
CD002900,"Overall, there was insufficient evidence to support a role for any specific type of vacuum aspiration in the treatment of early pregnancy termination."
CD002918,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of percutaneous radiofrequency lumbar sympathectomy. Where possible, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial."
CD002923,"Penfluridol is a well established long-acting antipsychotic. It is used in several different ways, most of them being used as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia. The drug is effective in treating acute schizophrenia, but not in chronic schizophrenia. It is not effective as a maintenance treatment for mentally retarded patients. Penfluridol may be considered for use as a depot medication for psychoses."
CD002928,Two studies show significant benefit of a buddy system for smoking cessation. Another study shows that the use of a buddy system is associated with higher abstinence rates and quit attempts.

CD003046,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the relative effectiveness of different ablation techniques in the treatment of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. When used as a first-line treatment, RF ablation may be more effective than percutaneous microwave coagulation (PMC) with a lower number of treatment sessions and a lower rate of complications. However, each randomised trial identified represents a different clinical setting in HCC and therefore the evidence base is limited. Consequently these data should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence becomes available."
CD003048,"There is evidence that probiotics are effective for treating acute diarrhoea. However, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in other settings. Certain probiotics have been shown to improve the quality of life of children with diarrhoea. However, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in other settings."

CD003076,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of unfractionated heparin for the treatment of proximal deep-vein thrombosis. In patients with acute leg DVT, UFH is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a lower incidence of major events (as assessed by the ultrasonographic clot volume score) than UFH. However, there is no evidence of a reduction in the risk of major bleeding or pulmonary embolism. UFH is associated with a higher incidence of recurrent thromboembolic events (as assessed by the ultrasonographic clot volume score) than UFH."
CD003078,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific CAPD system for prevention of peritonitis. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD003092,There is no evidence to suggest that PGE2 gel reduces uterine activity during labour or during labour-related interventions. There is a risk of cesarean section in the group of gel-treated women.
CD003132,"There is no evidence of effect of ultrasound on functional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Results suggest that in most parameters, improvements are greatest in groups 1 and 2 compared to groups 3 and 4. Using physical agents before isokinetic exercises leads to augmented exercise performance, reduced pain, and improved function."

There is evidence that the oral version of fluticasone propionate is more effective than the inhaled version.
CD003150,Aromatherapy with essential balm oil (Melissa officinalis) appears to be an effective treatment for agitation in people with severe dementia. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale trials of this type.
CD003153,We have not found evidence of effect of cycloserine in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Higher doses may be necessary.
CD003161,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD003175,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the rate of progression and death in endometrial cancer. Adequately powered trials are needed.
CD003198,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of L-tryptophan in the treatment of depression. When used as a primary treatment, L-tryptophan may have some benefits for treating anxiety and depressive disorders. However, most of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the treatment of depression in the era of antenatal steroid use and early use of L-tryptophan in combination with other classes of medication is indicated."
CD003204,"Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of providing iodine to young children in rural Sarawak. In contrast, iodised water by itself is adequate in delivering iodine uniformly to the whole community. Further high quality studies are required to assess the effectiveness of iodised water by itself and to determine the optimal dose and frequency of administration of iodised water."
CD003236,"The previous version of this review showed that exercise training improved physical function in people with end-stage renal disease when compared to usual care. This updated review provides evidence that in a similar population of patients, exercise does not increase the risk of hypertension, metabolic disturbances and cardiovascular disease. Exercise training may offer important improvements in patients' health-related quality of life."
CD003248,"There is evidence that early clamping of the umbilical cord reduces the risk of RBC transfusion and may have benefits on circulatory and respiratory support in preterm infants. However, there is no evidence that the results seen in the current trial are significant. There is a need for more trials of high methodological quality to confirm the preliminary results from this review."
CD003254,Intra-amniotic infection treated with intrapartum antibiotics is associated with a lower incidence of neonatal sepsis and a shorter neonatal hospital stay than treatment with postpartum antibiotics. There is no evidence of effect of intrapartum antibiotics on the length of neonatal hospital stay or the rate of endometritis.
CD003265,There is no evidence to suggest that prophylactic treatment with antibiotics is effective for preventing urinary tract infections in people with neuropathic bladder following SCI. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD003277,"Current evidence does not demonstrate a mortality benefit from CLB in patients with LGS. There is a risk of long-term adverse events from CLB, which is why it is recommended that patients be assessed for mortality."
CD003283,There is no evidence of difference in side effects between Loestrin and Triphasil and no evidence of difference between Loestrin and Ortho 10/11 and Ortho 7/7/7. The three regimens are effective and no pregnancies were reported. Cycle control was good with all three regimens but the incidence of intermenstrual bleeding was higher with the triphasic.
CD003289,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the absence of evidence of a treatment effect, motivational interviewing may be effective for reducing smoking behaviour in youth. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of different motivational interviewing methods, which is at present unclear. There is no definitive evidence from this review as to whether or not motivational interviewing has an effect on smoking behaviour in adolescents."
CD003296,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of all-trans retinoic acid for women with CIN II and III. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD003303,"Reading performance and preference for electronic vision enhancement devices (EVES) was significantly increased with the use of prism spectacles. However, there was no evidence from the trials on other optical aids such as magnifiers or optical magnification. With limited data on other low-vision aids, these results should be interpreted with caution. In addition to providing evidence for improved reading performance, this review provides a useful basis for practice."
CD003315,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific feeding method for infants with cleft lip and palate. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.

CD003318,"There is evidence that family planning services are effective in reducing the rate of HIV infection in people and in reducing the risk of childbirth. However, there is insufficient evidence for or against other aspects of family planning practice. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required to determine the effectiveness of PITC in different population groups, settings and settings."

CD003390,"Oral HTF has a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the antidepressant effects of antidepressants in patients with mild to moderate dementia. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of HTF compared to other antidepressants, which is at present unclear. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of HTF."
CD003401,"There is evidence that CSE is effective in providing pain relief during labour compared to epidural analgesia. There is no evidence that the rate of deceleration of the heart or the incidence of side-effects of CSE are reduced. CSE may be more effective in reducing the risk of maternal, fetal and neonatal side-effects than epidural analgesia."
CD003432,"Although laparoscopic colon resection is effective in the short term, there is no evidence of an improvement in long-term outcomes. In patients with low rectal cancer, laparoscopic resection is significantly more effective in terms of operative time, mortality and wound complications than open colon resection. However, there is no evidence of an improvement in long-term survival or quality of life. In patients with stage II and III colon cancer, laparoscopic resection is associated with a lower incidence of long-term complications and a better quality of life than open surgery."
CD003439,"Despite the most rigorous studies on the subject, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tobacco advertising to influence smoking behaviour."
CD003452,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of early orthodontic treatment with the Twin-block appliance or the Bass appliance for children with Class II, division 1 malocclusion. The results suggest that early treatment may be more effective than no treatment in the early permanent dentition. However, there is no evidence that the differences created by phase 1 treatment are less effective than differences between the Twin-block and Bass appliances. There is no evidence that the differences between the Twin-block and Bass appliances are less effective than differences between the two."
CD003476,"Olanzapine appears to be beneficial for patients with dementia-related psychosis. However, there is a risk of adverse events with this treatment. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies dementia. There is a risk of endpoints that are not statistically significant but that may be associated with dementia. These endpoints should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence becomes available."
CD003487,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of transpyloric feeding in the situation described. Where possible, nasogastric feeding should be used."
CD003544,There is some indication that naloxone may be useful for the suppression of polydipsia in patients with PIP syndrome. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD003546,Olanzapine appears to be beneficial for patients with hyperprolactinemia. There is no significant evidence for or against the use of quetiapine for sexual function. There is a limited evidence for the use of olanzapine in the treatment of sexual dysfunction in outpatients with schizophrenia.

CD003676,"Ibuprofen is more effective than sponging or unwrapping in controlling temperature in children with infectious diseases. However, this is based on a small study and there is no evidence of effect of antipyretic medication on other factors such as immune function or clinical symptoms. Further well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of ibuprofen compared to other antipyretic drugs and to examine whether there is a benefit of oral antipyretic therapy on other factors such as immune function or clinical symptoms."

This review provides evidence that progressive exercise, especially aerobic exercise, is effective for improving children's health-related fitness."
CD003710,"The two pacing modes used in this review are: dual chamber pacing (DDD) and dual chamber universal pacing (DDD). In patients with sinus-node dysfunction, DDD pacing is associated with less exercise, less breathlessness, and a greater sense of general well-being than VVI pacing. In patients with atrioventricular block or second-degree AV block, DDD pacing is associated with more exercise, less breathlessness, and a greater sense of general well-being than VVI pacing."
CD003719,"Urinary hCG appears to be equally effective as rHCG for inducing final follicular maturation and early luteinization in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation.

CD003745,"Early indomethacin therapy for PDA in VLBW infants is not associated with an improvement in respiratory sequelae. There is no evidence to suggest that early indomethacin therapy for PDA reduces the incidence of important shunts, and the number of surgical ligations. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field."
CD003797,"Ipratropium/fenoterol appears to be more effective than atropine sulfate alone in treating acute asthma. In patients with moderately severe asthma, the combination of ipratropium/fenoterol and ipratropium alone appears to be more effective than no drug treatment at all. The addition of fenoterol to existing treatment of acute asthma does not appear to have a significant effect on pulmonary function."
CD003808,"The Hall Technique appears to be a effective technique for managing deep caries lesions. There is no evidence of effect on clinical outcomes or outcomes after partial caries removal. In view of the poor prognosis of vital pulp treatment, a stepwise excavation approach is recommended."

CD003848,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of estradiol and progesterone replacement in the care of extremely preterm infants. However, it is possible that this treatment may be beneficial for bone mineral accretion and clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency of hormone replacement in the care of extremely premature infants."
CD003873,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of 6-MP for children with moderately- to-severe Crohn's disease. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD003895,"RHuEPO is effective in maintaining haemoglobin levels in stable haemodialysis patients. It is equally effective in maintaining a higher level of renal anemia. In patients with end-stage renal failure, the risk of peritonitis is increased. With the use of a single weekly dose, rHuEPO may be more effective than two or three times weekly treatment. In patients with anemia who are on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the risk of peritonitis is increased."
CD003901,"Adding long-acting beta 2-agonists to asthma treatment is effective in terms of symptom relief and may have benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. However, many of the studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of use of these agents in the era of antenatal steroid use and early intervention is indicated. Long-acting beta 2-agonists may be more effective than short-acting beta 2-agonists in terms of symptom relief and may have benefits on cardiovascular outcomes.

CD003933,A single trial suggests that maintenance terbutaline therapy administered by pump prolongs gestation in women in suspected preterm labour. There is no evidence that the use of terbutaline by pump reduces the risk of preterm delivery. There is no evidence that the use of terbutaline by pump reduces the risk of neonatal outcomes. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of terbutaline.
CD003989,"No evidence is available using different doses of ethinylestradiol is effective or not effective in preventing contraceptive failure. When used in combination with other oral contraceptives, the combined dose of ethinylestradiol is associated with a lower rate of discontinuation than the alone product. The additional dose of ethinylestradiol reduces the risk of bleeding. However, there is no evidence that the higher dose of ethinylestradiol has an adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness. When used in combination with other oral contraceptives, the combined dose of ethinylestradiol is associated with a lower rate of contraceptive failure than the alone product."
CD003993,"The use of thymosin alpha1 in treatment of cancer patients with advanced cancer is effective in terms of overall survival, complete response and skin reactions. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of thymosin alpha1 on outcomes such as mortality and leukopenia. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in advanced cancer patients where there is a risk of end-points that show the effects of thymosin on outcomes such as mortality and leukopenia."
CD004001,"Spinal cord stimulation may provide pain relief and may reduce the risk of amputation in patients with non-reconstructable critical leg ischaemia. However, the data on the effectiveness of SCS in reducing the incidence of death and increasing the rate of tissue loss in ischaemia is not significant. Based on the current evidence, there is no evidence to suggest that SCS reduces the risk of death and increases the rate of tissue loss in ischaemia. However, the data on the effectiveness of SCS in reducing the risk of arterial hypertension may be important in treating atherosclerotic patients."
CD004009,"The intramuscular route is more effective than the intrarectal route because of the lower dose-dependent resorption. However, there is no evidence of a difference in parasitological outcomes between routes. mortality and parasitaemia are similar in both groups. The main problems with intramuscular route are insufficient product retention and re-administration in 25% of patients and residual pain at the injection site in 12.5% of the children. The best evidence of efficacy is from intrarectal route because of the lower dose-dependent resorption."
CD004012,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bladder irrigation for people with neurogenic bladder. It is likely that there is a risk of obstruction and/or bacteremia with all of the irrigants examined. There is no apparent benefit from bladder irrigation for people with polymicrobial bacteriuria, which may explain why there is no evidence for this in the literature."
CD004026,"Day hospital care is more effective than inpatient treatment in terms of clinical outcomes, social function and quality of life. It is more effective in terms of length of treatment, and in terms of lower costs. However, there is no evidence of effect of day hospital care on long term outcomes."
CD004029,"Tizanidine appears to be similar to carbamazepine in terms of efficacy and safety. In patients with trigeminal neuralgia pain duration and severity, tizanidine appears to be similar to carbamazepine. In patients with trigeminal neuralgia pain frequency and severity, tizanidine appears to be similar to carbamazepine. In patients with trigeminal neuralgia pain duration and severity, tizanidine appears to be similar to carbamazepine."
CD004040,"Olanzapine appears to be superior to lithium in the treatment of acute bipolar disorder. In patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms, olanzapine appears to be superior to valproate or lithium. In patients with bipolar disorder who are inadequately responsive to lithium or valproate, olanzapine appears to be superior to either lithium or valproate. In patients with bipolar disorder who are partially responsive to valproate or lithium, olanzapine appears to be superior to either lithium or valproate."
CD004047,"Despite the high prevalence of dysthymic disorder, few controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of antidepressant medication for this disorder."
CD004064,"There is evidence that fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and leucovorin are superior to other regimens of fluorouracil alone. However, the evidence of effectiveness and safety in these regimens is less robust. The other regimens of choice are cisplatin, epirubicin, and leucovorin; cisplatin, epirubicin, and methotrexate. The favourable effects of fluorouracil on tumour response and time to progression in advanced gastric cancer are not clear. With limited data on other parameters, these regimens of"
CD004070,"Chlorhexidine vaginal irrigation may be effective in preventing the use of postnatal antibiotics for peripartal infection. However, there was insufficient evidence from the one-time irrigation data to support a role for the drug in preventing neonatal infection. There was no evidence from the small number of randomised controlled trials included in the review. The evidence base is limited due to the small number of women included in the studies and the lack of detailed outcome information. Nevertheless it seems desirable to conduct large randomised trials in this field."
CD004079,Use of aspirin for people with previous colorectal cancer is not associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of adenomas. There is a limited evidence for this in studies without steroids.
CD004139,"G-CSF may reduce the incidence of neutropenia, which may have implications for treatment scheduling. However, there is no evidence of effect on event-free survival or of reduced antibiotic use. In patients with HR ALL, G-CSF may not reduce the rate of hospitalisation or of myelosuppression. However, there is no evidence of the reduction of infection or of increased mortality. G-CSF may have benefits in high-risk ALL but not in all patients."
CD004147,"Since the last version of this review, new relevant studies have not provided additional information to change the conclusions. Published literature on the subject lacks the methodological rigour or robust reporting needed to make confident assessments of the effectiveness of contingency management in reducing drug use in outpatients."
CD004168,"The few studies included in the review did not allow conclusions about the effectiveness of interlock programs in reducing DUI recidivism. However, it seems desirable to develop or modify the effectiveness of interlock programs in order to reduce the number of offenders who participate and to make it more difficult to install interlocks."
CD004180,"The use of telephone consultations for same-day appointments is an effective means of reducing the use of primary healthcare services. However, there is insufficient information about the effectiveness of this strategy and whether it reduces overall workload. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD004182,There is no evidence to suggest the use of penicillamine for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is effective. The use of penicillamine for this purpose is unsafe and causes significant side effects. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of penicillamine in primary sclerosing cholangitis.
CD004228,"After a 10-minute educational session, women were given a nine-step self-help manual that contained information about the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy and the steps to follow. Women in the brief intervention condition were 5 times more likely to report abstinence after intervention compared to women in the assessment-only condition. This results from a small study. There is a need for more studies of high methodological rigour in order to determine the effectiveness of brief intervention for reducing alcohol consumption in pregnancy."
CD004236,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of amethocaine gel for children. When used for this purpose, amethocaine gel may be more effective than tetracaine-prilocaine cream in alleviating pain. However, the data on the quality and quantity of studies included in the review may not be interpretable due to the small number of participants in the studies. The available evidence is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of amethocaine gel for children."
CD004249,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of manipulation for mechanical neck pain. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD004251,The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. RCTs of PEMT in treatment of acute whiplash pain are needed.
CD004296,There is no evidence of effect of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of vascular events in patients with acute myocardial infarction. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of triflusal in the prevention of non-fatal cerebrovascular events. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of triflusal in the prevention of major hemorrhage.
CD004304,There is evidence that folic acid supplementation reduces the frequency of seizures in people with epilepsy. This result does not apply to the lack of benefit of folic acid alone. There is no evidence that the size of gingival hyperplasia is reduced with the use of folic acid. There is evidence that the incidence of hypocalcaemia and raised serum alkaline phosphatase are associated with the use of folic acid. These results do not apply to the lack of benefit of folic acid alone.
CD004306,No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in reducing the use of smokeless tobacco and reducing the risk of tobacco use and adverse outcomes.
CD004315,A single dose of BoNT/B is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with cervical dystonia. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD004316,"No specific recommendations can be made for the first line treatment of male contraception in the absence of evidence from the second. Appropriately designed male contraception regimens should be designed to allow men to choose the most effective regimens, and to allow them to tailor their regimens to their preferences."
CD004323,"There is evidence that APR is associated with less morbidity and better quality of life than an abdominoperineal resection. However, most of the studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of APR in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration is indicated. With limited data on other factors, such as age and gender, these results should still be interpreted with caution. Short-term data on quality of life are important for deciding the type of surgery to be performed in the era of antenatal steroid use and early surfactant administration."
CD004329,We found no evidence regarding the effectiveness of radiotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in the treatment of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The results suggest that there is no statistically significant difference between radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the rate of progression-free survival and overall survival in NPC.

The use of a postoperative catheter for bladder drainage is effective in reducing the incidence of infection and in reducing the length of hospital stay.
CD004379,"GnRH antagonists appear to be more effective than GnRH agonists in reducing ovarian hyperstimulation, and in preventing steroidogenesis. However, there is no evidence of effect from the long-term effects of GnRH antagonists on fertility. In poor responders, GnRH antagonists results in statistically significant lower cancellation rates, more oocytes per pickup, more embryos transferred, and a higher pregnancy rate."

CD004389,"primaquine when used in a supervised regimen is more effective than chloroquine when used in a combined regimens of primaquine and chloroquine. However, there is no evidence of effect of primaquine compared to either chloroquine or chloroquine, and the risk of relapse is higher with primaquine. This may explain why there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of primaquine compared to other regimens of antibiotics, and why the World Health Organization recommends a 14-day regimen. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of primaquine compared to other regimens of antibiotics, and although the risk of"
CD004402,"Corticosteroids have some theoretical advantages over placebo in the treatment of acute pharyngitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. However, there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute the use of corticosteroids for this purpose. Patients with suspected infectious mononucleosis are eligible for randomized controlled trials of their choice."
CD004408,There is no evidence to suggest that involuntary outpatient commitment reduces hospital use or reduces psychotic disorder. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.
CD004416,"Evening primrose oil appears to have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with atopic dermatitis. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of improvement of symptoms, but not in the overall severity of the disease. There was no significant difference in the rate of response of patients with atopic dermatitis when using evening primrose oil compared to placebo."
CD004423,No evidence is available using oral fluids before surgery is effective.
CD004437,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of streptokinase alone for the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism. There is a risk of bleeding when used in this manner. Patients with pulmonary embolism without hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction should be offered alteplase alone.
CD004439,"Oral ofloxacin appears to be as effective as parenteral antibiotics in the treatment of osteomyelitis. In patients with susceptible organisms, ofloxacin appears to be equally effective as tobramycin and ticarcillin.

In patients with resistant organisms, ofloxacin appears to be equally effective as tobramycin and ticarcillin."
CD004441,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of tai chi to prevent falls in the elderly. The intervention may have had some small effects on fall prevention in the villages in Taichung County. However, the lack of evidence from the control area suggests that there is no significant reduction in the risk of injurious falls. Further studies should clarify the effectiveness of tai chi in reducing the risk of injurious falls and to define the optimal dose and frequency of interventions."
CD004450,"deferoxamine may be as effective as deferiprone in the treatment of thalassemia major with few mild and reversible side effects. In view of the poor quality of the trials, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. Compared to deferoxamine, deferoxamine and L1 appeared to be similar in effectiveness to no more than a single injection. No significant differences were found in the rate of iron excretion or in the rate of fibrosis."
CD004455,There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the incidence of endomyometritis after forceps delivery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of endomyometritis.
CD004458,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of sinus irrigation in the treatment of CRS. In addition, there is limited evidence to support the use of surgical treatment of CRS. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be undertaken in settings where several individuals are receiving treatment."

CD004544,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific drug for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. endoscopic variceal ligation is an effective and safe alternative to propranolol. In patients with cirrhosis of the liver, propranolol is more effective than banding. However, there is no evidence that the two treatments are equally effective. With a mean time required to achieve an adequate reduction in the heart rate and the number of sessions needed to complete variceal ligation, the two treatments are similar."
CD004559,"There is no high quality evidence to support the use of herbs for treatment of influenza. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop and evaluate the use of herbs for treatment of influenza."
CD004567,The melanoma outcomes data collected in this review of RCTs of vitamin E and placebo does not exclude the possibility that these supplements prevent melanoma. There was a small mean benefit for aspirin in primary prevention (aspirin 100 mg daily) but it was not significant. There was no significant benefit for vitamin E in primary prevention (aspirin 100 mg daily) but it was not significant.

CD004588,"The additional studies tripled participant numbers providing data for analysis, and new, more stringent criteria for outcomes and analysis were used; conclusions about MIDCAB's lack of efficacy in LAD revascularization did not change. Given availability of more effective treatments including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and CABG, and the availability of more effective treatments including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and CABG, MIDCAB should be considered as a first-choice revascularization strategy in patients with LAD revascularization."
CD004591,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of lactase-treated preterm feeds. However, it is possible that this treatment may enhance weight gain. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings."
CD004597,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of this supplement for patients with cancer-associated wasting. In view of the modest number of patients included in the studies, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if this supplement has a role in patients with cancer-associated wasting."
CD004602,"The analgesic effects of acetaminophen, in combination with other analgesics, are clear. In postoperative pain patients, acetaminophen alone is a well established but imperfect treatment. With limited data on other analgesics, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions about the trade-offs for these benefits. The availability of more effective analgesics is currently underway."
CD004614,There is evidence that the use of pre-packed chloroquine tablets is a effective way to improve compliance with treatment of malaria. This review underlines the urgent need to develop effective methods of pre-packaging antimalarial drug treatment. There is a case for large studies of high methodological rigour in order to define the effectiveness of this technique and the optimal methods.
CD004621,"We found a diversity of interceptive approaches to PDC, ranging from the removal of the primary canine to the use of a cervical-pull headgear. The use of a headgear to intercept palatal displacement of maxillary canines is effective in terms of lower incidence of canine eruption and improved quality of life. However, there was insufficient evidence for other outcomes such as palatal displacement or eruption. Further interceptive approaches to PDC need to be conducted in large scale studies that include long-term follow-up."

CD004808,It is clear from the literature that different compliance strategies can be used to improve the quality of treatment of people with chronic disease.
CD004833,"Topical phenytoin appears to be a useful therapy for healing trophic ulcers in leprosy. The effectiveness (degree of wound healing measured as surface reduction) of this experimental therapy was compared with that of the usual therapy alone. At the same time the influence of the physical activity level on the effectiveness of both therapies was studied. The average wound healing of the experimental group and the control group was 388 mm2 (SD 498) and 260 mm2 (SD 260) respectively. Using the t-test, there was no statistically significant difference in wound healing between the two therapies (p = 1.7)."
CD004851,"Escitalopram appears to be effective for the treatment of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder. In comparisons with placebo, the results were similar in terms of improvement in terms of score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and other depression-related variables.

CD004897,There is evidence from one trial that high doses of NaHCO3 may be beneficial in treatment of patients with OP poisoning.
CD004898,"The results of this review confirm much that was already known but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. deprenyl appears to have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the risk of disability in patients with early Parkinson's disease. This effect is not clear from the data but may be due to the small number of participants in each study, the small number of participants in each study and the short follow-up."
CD004907,"One strategy that has been proposed for increasing the rate of vaginal delivery is a program of active management of labour that encourages early amniotomy, early diagnosis of slow progress in labour, and the use of higher than usual doses of oxytocin. There is no evidence that the use of oxytocin for early amniotomy and early diagnosis of slow progress in labour reduces the rate of cesarean section or reduces maternal satisfaction."
CD004916,There is evidence that the use of progressive addition lenses (PALs) is effective in slowing the progression of myopia. There is no evidence that the use of single vision lenses (SVLs) is effective.

CD004959,"Tramadol/APAP appears to be effective for the treatment of chronic low back pain. In comparisons with placebo, tramadol/APAP showed significant improvements in pain relief, role-emotional quality of life, and clinical outcomes. However, there was little evidence regarding the risk of abuse and side-effects. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of tramadol/APAP compared to placebo or other opioid regimens in chronic low back pain."
CD004976,"There is unclear evidence that different antihistamine-decongestant combinations are superior to placebo in the treatment of symptoms of the common cold.

CD005030,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the absence of evidence from a large scale randomized controlled trial of choice, motivational interviewing may be an effective means of reducing the use of drugs in high-risk youth. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of the two studies included in this review, which are separate and separate studies. The conclusions of the review do not apply to the lack of evidence from the two studies included in this review."
CD005040,"Risperidone appears to be beneficial for children with autism. In comparisons with placebo, risperidone was associated with a 56.9 percent reduction in the Irritability score, as compared to a 14.1 percent decrease in the placebo group. In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight weeks, the benefit was maintained at six months. Risperidone appears to be beneficial for children with autism."
CD005060,"Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) appears to be beneficial for patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes. There is no evidence of effect on HbA1c (as assessed by the per-protocol analysis) in the SMBG group compared to control. However, there is a small difference in the rate of remission (as assessed by the per-protocol analysis) in the SMBG group compared to the control group. This may be because of the small number of participants in each group, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed information about the outcomes. Nevertheless, it seems"
CD005064,"Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. Surprisingly, Benzodiazepines are not the most common drugs used for alcohol withdrawal. Other drugs such as clomethiazole and chlormethiazole may be useful. Short-term data indicate that the clomethiazole treatment is associated with fewer side effects than the clomethiazole treatment. Short-term data are also inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of the clomethiazole treatment compared to the other drugs. Short-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in"
CD005103,The previous version of this review showed that CSII was superior to multiple daily injections of insulin glargine in improving metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. This updated review provides evidence that the superior treatment is not only possible but effective in improving health-related quality of life.
CD005112,Infliximab appears to be effective in the treatment of moderately active ulcerative colitis. Patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis who are not currently receiving immunomodulators are more likely to have a clinical response when treated with infliximab.

CD005393,"Stapled hemorrhoidectomy may offer a number of advantages over excision hemorrhoidectomy, including less pain, a shorter hospital stay and a quicker return to work. Results from one trial suggest that in the short term stapled haemorrhoidectomy may be associated with less pain, a shorter hospital stay and a more effective return to work. Conversely, closed haemorrhoidectomy appeared to be similar to other hemorrhoid procedures in terms of operative time, pain, complications and satisfaction. The availability of low-cost stapled haemorrhoids is currently unclear."

CD005495,There is evidence that early intervention programs can improve the neurodevelopment of preterm infants.
CD005511,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific method of retreatment for endodontic teeth. The choice of whether to proceed with retreatment based on the shortest follow-up period is important. In addition to direct costs, endodontic retreatment may have other consequences in terms of time off work, unscheduled visits and suffering. To establish a foundation for the appraisal of such indirect and intangible costs the present study was set up in which patients' assessments of pain and swelling after surgical and nonsurgical retreatment procedures were recorded."

CD006201,"There is unclear evidence that melarsoprol is effective for the treatment of second-stage Trypanosomiasis. In patients with sleeping sickness, melarsoprol is comparable to other regimens, although with a higher risk of treatment failure. In patients with central nervous system involvement, melarsoprol is more effective than nifurtimox. However, the quality and quantity of the other regimens did not change. Given the low quality of the other regimens, and the lack of evidence that melarsoprol is superior to other regimens, the evidence base is limited."
CD006212,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of filters in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. Patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis with or without filter may be at risk of pulmonary embolism.

CD006247,We found no clear evidence to support the use of a cooked or raw diet in patients with cancer for prevention of infection. The results of this review confirm the need for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour to determine the effectiveness of a cooked or raw diet in preventing infection in patients with cancer.
CD006254,"The calcimimetic agent R-568 appears to be effective in reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with mild secondary hyperparathyroidism but not in those with more severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with end-stage renal disease, the drug may be effective in reducing calcium and phosphorus levels. However, there is no evidence of effect on serum calcium and phosphorus levels and no evidence of effect on vitamin D levels. Adverse event rates were low and mostly mild to moderate in severity. In patients with end-stage renal disease the drug may be associated with increased risk of serious adverse events"

CD006483,We found some limited evidence of effects on risk reduction behaviors attributable to computer-based instruction. This review underlines the urgent need to develop more effective interventions for adolescents.
CD006525,There is increasing evidence that collaborative care programs are effective for improving the quality of primary care treatment of depression. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale trials of high methodological quality. There is new safety data which indicates that the following interventions are associated with high mortality and high health care costs.
CD006559,"The CPG has been used to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in hospital intensive care and to reduce the costs of VAP. However, although the CPG has been used to reduce the incidence of VAP, it does not reduce the overall costs of VAP. This is because of the high attrition bias of the CPG and the small number of participants in the study. There is no convincing evidence to support the use of the CPG for reducing the incidence of VAP."

CD006884,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of methotrexate for maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In patients with IBD where prednisone is the only treatment, methotrexate may be effective in reducing the risk of relapse. However, this is not a definitive answer. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of methotrexate."

CD007302,"Vigabatrin appears to be an effective add-on therapy to existing antiepileptic therapy. In patients with refractory epilepsy, VGB is associated with a significant reduction in seizure frequency and in the frequency of partial seizures. In comparison to placebo, VGB is associated with a smaller mean reduction in seizure frequency and in the number of partial seizures, but there is no evidence of a difference in the rate of remission. Adverse effects are generally mild and consist of drowsiness, nausea, and constipation."
CD007303,"Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that epoetin alfa may improve quality of life in patients with cancer while maintaining haemoglobin levels.

CD007360,"Usefulness of two alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists, naftopidil and tamsulosin hydrochloride, in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia is unclear. However, there is evidence of an early effect from the administration of naftopidil in improving storage and nocturia. In the reduction of bladder outlet obstruction, the use of a anticholinergic agent and a alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist was associated with significant improvements. However, there was no evidence of an effect of the anticholinergic agent"

CD007440,The analgesic efficacy of diflunisal is comparable to aspirin and placebo in the first hours of treatment. It is more effective than Codeine phosphate in the first hours of pain relief but not in the last. Diflunisal appears to be a useful adjunct to aspirin and codeine in the treatment of oral surgery.
CD007444,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between isosorbide dinitrate and misoprostol for the rate of cervical ripening before surgical termination of pregnancy. In comparisons with placebo, isosorbide dinitrate had a similar effect on cervical ripening to misoprostol, but with no difference in the frequency of side effects. A trans-vaginal administration of nitric oxide donors is more effective than a non- nitric oxide donor in terms of lower cumulative force required to dilate the cervix to 8 mm and a higher cervical diameter. However, women in the misoprostol group"

CD007570,"Although lactulose and PEG 3350 are effective in the treatment of constipation, there is insufficient evidence to recommend either for children. Both treatments are effective in reducing hard stools and decreasing the ease of passage of stool. However, although lactulose can be considered as a pre-biotic, it may be advisable to use only PEG 3350 for this treatment. Both treatments are effective in reducing the rate of constipation and in preventing the recurrence of faecal impaction. However, although both treatments are effective, there is evidence that the"

This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from this intervention that may be attributable to patient-oriented design.
CD007629,There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of ischemic preconditioning for major liver resection under vascular exclusion. This maneuver reduces the incidence of complications after hepatic resection but does not reduce the risk of death. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies ischemic preconditioning for major liver resection.
CD007632,"There is evidence from one trial that IP reduces operative blood loss and may be more effective than selective clamping in preventing hepatocellular damage. However, there is no evidence that the latter is more effective in preventing ischemic injury. There is a risk of postoperative complications such as abdominal collections and pulmonary complications. Further well designed RCTs should be conducted in settings where several individuals perform the procedures."
CD007635,We found a significant benefit for patients undergoing colonic resection using a fast-track protocol. This strategy reduces the rate of complications and length of hospital stay and may reduce patient satisfaction. There is no evidence of adverse effects on physical and mental function or on the rate of complications.

There is a risk of thromboembolic events, which may explain why the drug is not being recommended in such patients. There is no clear evidence that the risk of serious adverse events is increased with the use of rFVIIa. The risk of bleeding may be reduced with the use of a more effective treatment."
CD007921,Use of a distal vein cuff for PTFE bypass grafts is not effective based on one study. There is no evidence of effect of this type of graft on patency or limb salvage in patients with critical leg ischaemia. The use of a distal vein cuff for PTFE bypass is effective in terms of primary patency and limb salvage but not in terms of overall survival.

CD008148,"Corticosteroids are used for treating antepartum HELLP syndrome, but evidence from two randomised controlled trials, treating either dexamethasone or betamethasone, does not demonstrate a significant effect on disease recovery. A third trial showed significant benefit of a high-dose corticosteroid treatment over a placebo ( 10 mg every 12 hours) in reducing the length of hospitalisation and reducing the risk of serious maternal morbidity. The evidence from this review is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids for treatment of HELLP."
CD008152,"The addition of primaquine to other Acts of ART is effective in reducing parasitaemia and in reducing the risk of reinfection. However, there is no evidence of effect on gametocyte clearance and therefore it is not possible to assess the effect of primaquine on these outcomes. There is no evidence of effect of artesunate alone on parasitaemia or on the rate of reappearance of malaria. In patients with severe malaria, primaquine appears to be more effective than chloroquine in reducing the number of parasites in the bloodstream.

CD008312,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific interventions for people with epilepsy to improve their compliance with anticonvulsant therapy.
CD008320,"Based on the limited evidence available, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of pruritus in haemodialysis patients. Surprisingly, corticosteroids have not been a research focus for pruritus, although these drugs are frequently used. Recent research seems to focus on the SSRIs, which may be beneficial although there is no evidence currently. pruritus can be treated with a variety of drugs, ranging from non-opioid drugs to drugs that alter the 5-HT(3) receptors. The 5-HT(3) receptors are associated with pain and may be associated with a number of outcomes"
CD008326,There is evidence from one trial that TDR is superior to fusion in terms of clinical outcomes. There is no evidence that the risk of complications is reduced. TDR may be more effective than fusion in treating chronic low back pain.
CD008366,The Hartslag Limburg intervention showed a limited effect on walking. There was no evidence of an effect on smoking or high-fat diet. There was a small increase in the frequency of cholesterol checkups. There was no evidence of an effect on the rate of exercise or on the quality of life in the communities.
CD008386,"Atorvastatin may be beneficial for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It may be beneficial for people with early episode multiple sclerosis. It may be beneficial for people with early episode multiple sclerosis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of atorvastatin as a add-on therapy to interferon beta. The beneficial effects of atorvastatin on early episode multiple sclerosis are not clear from the data."
CD008392,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from the use of preoperative ibuprofen for pain relief in children. However, there is a possibility that the use of preoperative ibuprofen may increase the risk of adverse effects on health. Further research is needed to determine the optimal use of preoperative ibuprofen for pain relief in children."
CD008407,"Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are highly effective for the relief of pain after episiotomy. In comparisons with placebo, the two active drugs were significantly more effective for the pain intensity and relief, respectively. There was no evidence from the trials on the quality of pain relief."
CD008408,"We have not found evidence that either sweet taste or chewing gum reduces pain scores during routine immunization procedures. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that both actions may have analgesic effects. The current review provides evidence that in certain children, both sucrose and lidocaine-prilocaine may have analgesic effects."
CD008444,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of ischemic stroke in a hospital. In the absence of evidence to support the routine administration of ischemic stroke in a hospital, these patients should be offered to a care setting that is more effective in terms of care, length of hospitalisation and outcomes."
CD008445,"There is no evidence to suggest that hypothermia, when used during aneurysm surgery, reduces mortality or morbidity in patients with aneurysm surgery. However, it may increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are more likely to experience postoperative bacteremia. There is no evidence that mild hypothermia is effective for patients with acute aneurysm"
CD008502,"We found a limited evidence of effect of low-dose baclofen on the management of AWS. This review does not cover the relative effectiveness of baclofen compared to other benzodiazepines, which is at present unclear. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of baclofen compared to other benzodiazepines in the management of AWS."
CD008538,"Although treatment with corticosteroids induces remission in Crohn's disease, prolonged exposure to corticosteroids is undesirable. This randomised clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (sargramostim), an activator of innate immunity, in patients with Crohn's disease. There was no significant difference in the rate of the primary end point of a clinical response defined by a decrease of at least 70 points in the CDAI score on day 57 between the sargramostim and placebo groups. However, significantly more patients in the sargram"
CD008562,Human activated protein C (APC) and low-dose heparin (8 U kg(-1) for 24 h may be a safer and more effective treatment for DIC in acute leukaemia. There is no significant evidence for or against the use of APC in the treatment of DIC.
CD008600,There is evidence that the use of a decision aid to help patients with atrial fibrillation make more informed decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy is effective. The quality of OAT obtained through self-management is at least as high as that delivered by specialized physicians at anticoagulation clinics.
CD008635,"There is unclear evidence that the different regimens of umbilical cord care used in different settings are effective in terms of time to cord separation, and in terms of mortality."
CD008686,"Although the use of roentgenogram technology for evaluating acute low back pain is effective, the quality and quantity of research done in this field is insufficient. There is a case for more RCTs of lumbosacral spine radiographs, in which the aim is to reduce the radiation burden."
CD008691,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of DSE in the risk assessment of renal transplantation. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD008739,There is evidence from one trial that weekly fluconazole prophylaxis is effective in preventing oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis in women with HIV. This review underlines the urgent need to develop effective treatments for candidiasis in women with HIV.
CD008896,"There is evidence that in countries where family planning is available at the doorstep, the provision of contraceptive counseling is effective. This review provides evidence that the use of contraceptive advice at the doorstep is effective. There is no evidence that the use of contraceptive advice at the doorstep is effective."
CD008914,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific stent for internal drainage of the pancreatic duct in patients undergoing PD. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods, the review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest stent available. Further randomised trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of external stenting for internal drainage of the pancreatic duct in patients undergoing PD."
CD008933,"Interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate appear to be effective in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanism of action of the beta preparations is unknown and the results of the trials are unclear. Further high quality trials are required to determine the effectiveness of interferon beta-1a in treating RRMS."
CD008987,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of prosthesis for displaced radial head fracture. The most effective treatment for this type of fracture is open reduction and internal fixation. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of prosthesis for this type of fracture."
CD009046,There is no high quality evidence that bupropion is an effective treatment for smoking cessation in the indigenous Maori population. There is a small evidence that it is effective at increasing quit rates. There is no high quality evidence that it is effective at reducing smoking behaviour.
CD009058,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of cryosurgery for treatment of LM. The intervention may have important effects on LM in terms of intraoperative tumor reduction and survival. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD009062,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of hypnosis for pain management in childbirth. Although the intervention shows some promise, further research is needed before recommendations can be made regarding its clinical usefulness for pain management in maternity care."
CD009107,"Overall, the findings of this review demonstrated insufficient evidence to support a specific type of treatment for pain during labour."
CD009131,"There is evidence that cognitive training is effective in reducing symptoms of fatigue and in improving quality of life in people with sclerosis. However, there is insufficient evidence for or against other types of cognitive training. In the absence of evidence for or against other types of cognitive training, these results should be interpreted with caution."
CD009189,We found some limited evidence of effect from the in-person intervention. It is clear from the literature that it is possible to set up or set up telephone-delivered psychotherapy to reduce depressive and psychiatric symptoms in people living with HIV. This could be used to support adherence to antiretroviral therapy.
CD009209,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of a workplace-based weight loss program for male shift workers. The LiSM program appears to be effective for improving PA, APFT and metabolic parameters in male office workers. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic."
CD009215,"There is no high quality evidence that aromatherapy reduces pain perception and/ or outcomes during labour, and further research is needed."
CD009217,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that in the US, non-pharmacological interventions for hypertension are effective. In people with high normal blood pressure, these interventions are effective in terms of lower BP, less in the use of antihypertensive drugs and in terms of lower cardiovascular events. Further studies evaluating the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for hypertension in the US are needed."
CD009337,"There is evidence from one trial that a social marketing campaign to increase the frequency of HIV testing among men who have sex with men is effective in reducing the risk of syphilis. However, the campaign was not effective in reducing the use of recreational drug use and in reducing the use of syphilis. Further trials are needed to determine if there are lessons to be learned from the experience of this campaign."

However, there is no evidence that the use of national guidelines for pain management in maternity care is effective. There is evidence that the use of national guidelines for pain management in maternity care is effective in terms of reduced use of antibiotics, use of perineal suturing, and use of steroids in preterm delivery."
CD009411,"Before myeloablative therapy, patients with HL were treated with high-dose chemotherapy (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) followed by high-dose chemotherapy with no transplantation. This treatment is associated with more adverse effects and does not improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed HL. Compared with conventional high-dose chemotherapy, additional SHDCT is associated with more adverse effects and does not improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed HL."
CD009414,"An intervention designed to provide more information and more information about risk assessments in prenatal care is effective in reducing the risk of IPV during pregnancy and in post-partum. It does not reduce the risk of major depressive episode or PTSD, but it does reduce both. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed interventions in prenatal care that provide more information and more information about risk assessments."
CD009497,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of allopurinol as a treatment for advanced colonic cancer. However, it may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic."
CD009510,"There is evidence that ranibizumab is an effective treatment for macular edema secondary to non-ischemic branch retinal vein occlusion. In patients with macular edema after BRVO, treatment with ranibizumab as needed results in a rapid reduction in CFT to a similar level as that in the 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg treatment groups and an improvement in BCVA. However, there is no evidence of effect of ranibizumab for primary treatment of macular edema after BRVO."
CD009607,"There is evidence that swimming has a small benefit on aerobic capacity in children and adolescents with asthma.

CD009779,"Early endoscopic intervention, whether by endoscopists or other means, appears to reduce systemic and local inflammation in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis and biliopancreatic obstruction. It may be advisable to carry out this intervention early."
CD009882,"A single trial has shown that teriflunomide, in doses of 7 to 14 mg, reduces relapse rate and disease activity in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. It must be decided whether this can be extrapolated to other RRs of teriflunomide in this setting."
CD010119,"The use of routine monitoring and evaluation systems to assess a referral model of family planning and HIV service integration is effective in reducing the use of services and improving the quality of services. This review provides evidence that in a resource-constrained setting, providing family planning with HIV testing and testing is likely to increase the use of services and improve the quality of services."
CD010155,We found no clear evidence to support the use of heparin for the treatment of acute painful crisis of sickle cell anemia.
CD010245,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tranexamic acid for hip fracture surgery. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.
