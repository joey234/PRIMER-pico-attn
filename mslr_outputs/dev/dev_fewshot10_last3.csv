CD008386,"No studies have compared atorvastatin with other statins such as cholesterol lowering drug Lipitor or with nootropics such as dopamine. However, a small body of evidence suggests that statins may have therapeutic potential in immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis. We aimed to establish whether add-on of simvastatin, a statin with anti-inflammatory properties, improves this efficacy. We enrolled treatment-naive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial of simvastatin.
