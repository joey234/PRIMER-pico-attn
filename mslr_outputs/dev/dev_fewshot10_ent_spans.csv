CD000019,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of prophylactically administered thyrotropin-releasing hormone on the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Many of the trials have not yet been published in final form and subjected to peer review. In addition, all the studies reported here were conducted before the widespread use of erythromycin."
CD000020,"The incidence of immunisation during or immediately after the first pregnancy in women who had no previous story of blood transfusions or of terminations of pregnancy is 1.11%, which is a figure relatively low as compared with studies of series carried out in North America, but close to those carried out in other European centres. When primipara of all categories are lumped together the frequency rises to 1.5%. A study of the passage of fetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation shows that at the 29th week of pregnancy out of 1,884 cases there were 5.5% positive thereal kleihau"
CD000025,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the outcomes of women with preeclampsia. The results suggest that magnesium sulfate may improve the outcomes of women with preeclampsia. However, the current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate compared to control groups or other anticonvulsants in preventing eclampsia properly."

However, there was no significant benefit from gonadotropin alone in the trials. This observation might be explained by the fact that gonadotropin is more effective than oral gonadotropin in preventing prophylactic abortion in patients with polycystic ovarian disease."
CD000424,"We have not found evidence that bromocriptine is effective or not effective in the treatment of patients with acute cerebral ischemia. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of the drug in the treatment of patients with other aphasia such as pyloric stenosis."

CD000566,"There is still controversy over whether or not patients should be hyperventilated after traumatic brain injury, and a randomized trial has never been conducted. The theoretical advantages of hyperventilation are cerebral vasoconstriction for intracranial pressure (ICP) control and reversal of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acidosis. Possible disadvantages include cerebral vasoconstriction to such an extent that cerebral ischemia ensues, and only a short-lived effect on CSF pH with a loss of HCO3-buffer from CSF. The latter disadvantage might be overcome by the addition"
