CD000019,"Presently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of thyrotropin-releasing hormone for preterm infants. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised trials on this topic."
CD000020,Antepartum treatment of women with suspected rhesus disease may be effective in preventing the spread of the disease to other women. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised trials on the effectiveness of anti-D Ig in the initial hospital stay or in the first few months of pregnancy.
CD000025,"There is evidence that magnesium sulfate may be effective for preventing the development of eclampsia in women with severe preeclampsia. However, there is no evidence that it is effective for preventing the antepartum seizure. Women with severe preeclampsia are advised to be treated with magnesium sulfate in both groups."
CD000036,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of p.o.R. in the treatment of IGR. Patients with IGR need to be assessed in an outpatient setting. Patients with IGR should be assessed in an ambulatory setting.
CD000052,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of metered dose inhalers with spacers in the treatment of children with acute asthma in the emergency department. Patients with acute asthma in the ED were more likely to be treated with metered dose inhalers with spacers, which resulted in a smaller mean reduction in treatment time and medication use compared to nebulisers. This may explain why there is limited evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of metered dose inhalers with spacers in the treatment of children with acute asthma in the emergency department."
CD000088,There is evidence that psychosocial treatment of schizophrenia is effective in reducing relapse and improving medication compliance. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD000093,"We found some limited evidence of benefit of the sliding screw in the treatment of unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures. In patients with unstable trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures, the sliding screw showed a statistically significant advantage over the standard nail. However, most of the data were from studies that were not conducted in the era of antenatal fixation."
CD000126,There is inconclusive evidence for a role for anaesthetic in reducing myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing carotid surgery. This is based on randomised controlled trials. No outright evidence was found to support or refute the use of any specific anaesthetic in the event of a myocardial ischemia.
CD000148,"There is no evidence that carnitine treatment improves fetal growth. There is a small number of studies which show a beneficial effect of carnitine treatment in the situation of placental insufficiency. However, these studies are small and the evidence of benefit is limited. There is no evidence that carnitine treatment improves the rate of retardation in the fetus."
CD000164,There is evidence that vitamin K and phenobarbital may be effective for preventing intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm newborns. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of vitamin K and phenobarbital in preterm newborns.
CD000165,There is no high quality evidence that SMOCC is effective in terms of uptake and uptake in general practice. There is limited evidence that SMOCC is effective in terms of uptake in general practice. There is limited evidence that SMOCC is effective in terms of uptake in general practice.
CD000187,"Oral anticoagulation may be useful for the prevention of major vascular events in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The beneficial effects of oral anticoagulation are limited due to the small number of participants and the small sample size. However, it is clear from the literature that indobufen has a significant advantage over warfarin in the secondary prevention of major vascular events in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The beneficial effects of oral anticoagulation are limited due to the small number of participants and the small sample size. However, it is clear from"
CD000201,"There is evidence that ergometrine is effective in preventing postpartum haemorrhage. However, it is not clear that the ergometrine component reduces the risk of postpartum hemorrhage or that there is a significant benefit from ergometrine compared to oxytocin. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of ergometrine compared to oxytocin, and to determine the optimal dose of ergometrine. These trials should be conducted in settings where there is a high risk of postpartum hemorrhage."
CD000212,Sulphasalazine is an antirheumatic drug that has some theoretical advantages over other treatments such as methotrexate. It is not clear that it has a significant effect on the disease activity of patients with psoriatic arthritis. An open study of 30 patients in each group showed a statistically significant difference between SASP and placebo. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of sulphasalazine in different clinical subgroups of psoriatic arthritis.
CD000277,"Treatment with calcium antagonists in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage is effective in reducing the occurrence of severe neurologic deficits due to cerebral arterial spasm. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of calcium antagonists in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD000301,"The response of active and quiescent Crohn's disease to prednisone, sulfasalazine, or azathioprine has been studied in 569 patients in a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter cooperative trial. The response of active symptomatic disease to prednisone or sulfasalazine was significantly better than to placebo. Response to azathioprine was better than to placebo, but the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance. Patients with colonic involvement were especially responsive to sulfasalazine, and those with small bowel involvement were especially responsive to prednisone. There is less than a"
CD000313,"Early discharge planning may be useful in reducing the length of hospital stay and in improving the quality of patient care. However, implementation of the program is unclear due to the small number of patients included in the studies and the heterogeneity of the outcome measures. Further well-designed and powered randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of early discharge planning in reducing length of hospital stay and in improving quality of patient care."
CD000328,"Early HFJV treatment reduces the incidence of pulmonary morbidity and mortality, and reduces the risk of acute air leak. However, there is a higher incidence of severe IVH andPVL in infants treated with HFJV compared with CV, and a higher incidence of hypocarbia. This could be because the early HFJV treatment reduces the incidence of BPD, decreases exposure to hypocarbia, and reduces the risk of grade III-IV IVH and/or PVL. However, there is a higher incidence of severe"
CD000332,There is evidence that erythropoietin is effective in treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with RA. The results of this review confirm the results of one trial which showed a significant benefit from erythropoietin in treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with RA. The results of this review confirm the results of one trial which showed a significant benefit from erythropoietin in treating anemia of chronic disease in patients with RA.
CD000353,There is some indication that homeopathy may be an adjunct to medication for children with asthma. This is not conclusive. There is no evidence that homeopathy is superior to placebo for improving the quality of life of children with asthma.
CD000361,There is evidence that IVIG prophylactically prevents the occurrence of sepsis in preterm infants. This is based on randomised controlled trials. No evidence is available using a single dose of IVIG in preterm infants.
CD000387,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm the preliminary results of this review.
CD000391,"There is evidence that methotrexate may be a useful adjunct to oral prednisone treatment in the treatment of asthma. In severe asthma, where steroid-dependent patients require long-term oral prednisone treatment, methotrexate may be a useful adjunct to corticosteroid therapy. However, the data on prednisone requirements and effectiveness in this population of patients is limited due to the small number of patients studied, the lack of a trial-derived outcome that could be used to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of methotrexate in this setting."
CD000407,"There is evidence that oral corticosteroids can reduce morbidity and pulmonary function in patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis. The beneficial effects of oral corticosteroids are limited due to side-effects. Patients with mild to moderate cystic fibrosis are more likely to experience side-effects from oral corticosteroids. These include interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 receptor over-expression, interleukin-2 receptor over-expression, cytokine concentrations and adverse effects on clinical outcomes."
CD000412,"Treatment of patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome with either GnRH-agonist or GnRH-down-regulation before gonadotropin administration is effective. The results of this review are limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies. Nevertheless it is clear that in the event of polycystic ovarian syndrome, GnRH-agonist treatment is superior to no treatment or stimulation of the follicles with gonadotropin-releasing hormone is effective."
CD000424,"We found no evidence to support the use of bromocriptine as a treatment for chronic aphasia. In patients with chronic aphasia, the risk of end-stage aphasia is high. Consequently, bromocriptine should be considered only as a adjunct to other therapies. We recommend the use of other drugs for aphasia in such patients."
CD000459,"No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. The update identified six new studies, most of them reporting on interventions not included in the original version. However, the conclusions of the review did not change."
CD000498,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of intraventricular streptokinase treatment for post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. In patients with post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus, streptokinase treatment may be more effective than ventriculoperitoneal shunt treatment because it may reduce the risk of re-bleeding, ventriculitis or meningitis. However, the data on these two studies are not adequate to make recommendations for the use of intraventricular streptokinase in the treatment of post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus."
CD000503,There is evidence that limiting a newborn's intake of fluids during the first three days of life reduces mortality and morbidity in infants with low-birth-weight. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of fluid choice.
CD000527,"There is no high quality evidence that quinine is superior to artemisinin in treating severe malaria. In patients with severe malaria where incubation period and mortality are important, quinine tends to be more effective than artemether. Patients who were treated with quinine were more likely to experience serious adverse effects, such as encephalitis, diarrhea and pneumonia. The risk of death from severe malaria in patients treated with quinine is less than those who were treated with artemether."
CD000566,"There is still controversy over whether or not patients should be hyperventilated after traumatic brain injury, and a randomized trial has never been conducted. The theoretical advantages of hyperventilation are cerebral vasoconstriction for intracranial pressure (ICP) control and reversal of brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acidosis. Possible disadvantages include cerebral ischemia ensues, and only a short-lived effect on CSF pH with a loss of HCO3-buffer from CSF. The latter disadvantage might be overcome by the addition of the buffer tromethamine (THAM), which has shown"
CD000954,"The serotonin receptor blocker ketanserin appears to be effective in the treatment of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon in patients with systemic scleroderma. In one trial, there was a significant improvement in the rate of numbness, pain and paresthesia after treatment with ketanserin. However, there was no significant improvement in the rate of systemic blood pressure, or in the rate of improvement of Dysphagia. The beneficial effects of ketanserin appear to be similar to placebo. In the main clinical trial, there were no significant improvements in the rate of numbness, pain and paresthesia"
CD000968,There is some indication that attention training may be effective in improving cognitive function in people with schizophrenia. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD001021,"Inhaled tobramycin appears to be effective in preventing the decline in pulmonary status of patients with mild lung disease who are treated with antibiotics. However, there is no evidence of effect oncolonies or ototoxicity. A further randomised controlled trial of appropriate size is needed to confirm the results of this review."
CD001035,"There is evidence that a small-scale, computer-based, Trainer-based intervention can increase the use of dual-contraceptive methods in women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. This intervention may be useful in reducing the frequency of women reporting their use of dual methods, which may reduce the risk of getting an STI or unintended pregnancy. The trial data suggest that the use of dual methods is more likely to be reported as a success in the intervention."
CD001054,"There is evidence that home visits can reduce the incidence of fractures in elderly people. This finding is not conclusive due to the small number of people included in the trials, the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes, and the small number of people included in the trials."
CD001076,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the current recommendations of the review. The review does not cover any specific interventions or interventions that might be useful in the treatment of preterm infants or infants with preterm weight.
CD001088,"There is some indication that motivational interviewing may be effective for people with early psychosis who are using drugs or alcohol. However, the data on substance use and outcomes are limited and further research is needed."
CD001108,Treatment with antifungal agents is effective in reducing symptoms of asthma in people with chronic lung aspergillosis. The antifungal agents reduce symptoms of asthma in people with chronic lung aspergillosis. The antifungal agents reduce symptoms of asthma in people with chronic lung aspergillosis.
CD001125,"There is evidence that CPA, CPA, and flutamide are effective in the treatment of hirsutism. In the sample sizes examined in this review, there was no significant difference between the drugs in their effect on hair diameter, Plasma testosterone levels or the response to a LHRH test. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence was found comparing oral contraceptive with oral contraceptive or other antiandrogen drugs."
CD001158,Prednisone may be as effective as chloroquine for treating RA disease activity and bone mass in patients with RA but the adverse effects on these two measures are not clear. Patients with RA who were on prednisone for more than 6 months showed a significant decline in bone mass. This could be because the drug inhibits the immune system's ability to repair damaged tissues. Short-term data are lacking for many of the outcomes.
CD001177,There is evidence that topical pain relief can be provided for painful exuding wounds of various aetiologies. The results show that topical pain relief can be provided for painful exuding wounds of various aetiologies.
CD001181,"The use of antibiotics for prevention of intestinal infections is still a topic of debate. While most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality, the results suggest that there is a need for more antibiotic prophylaxis in the case of colon, rectal and GI surgery."
CD001190,The drug shown to be beneficial for people with mild to severe Alzheimer's disease is also effective in people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. The drug is not effective in people with Alzheimer's disease who are not in a nursing home. It is unclear whether the drug has any adverse effects on people with Alzheimer's disease. One possible adverse effect that could be attributed to the drug is a transient increase in the risk of dementia.
CD001211,"There is evidence that besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension is effective in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. In patients with bacterial conjunctivitis, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension is significantly more effective than vehicle. The beneficial effects of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension on long term outcomes are not clear. In patients with bacterial conjunctivitis, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension is safe and effective."
CD001216,There is no evidence of mortality reduction from faecal occult blood testing when used as a form of colorectal cancer screening. There is a risk of overdiagnosis when used as a form of cancer screening. There is a risk of infection when used as a form of cancer screening.
CD001230,There is evidence that brief group counseling is effective for reducing HIV risk among homosexual API men. This finding should be interpreted with caution because of the small number of participants in the studies and the small number of participants in the included studies. Short-term HIV prevention training of high methodological quality is needed in order to assess the effectiveness of this intervention for different populations of API men.
CD001242,"The two trials included in this review provide evidence that dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in raising MAP and in maintaining MAP. However, the data on intestinal perfusion is not significant. This review does not cover the effects of dopamine on intestinal quality."
CD001247,"Early administration of acetaminophen to patients with acute stroke may reduce CBT and may reduce the risk of hypothermia. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute other lines of treatment of stroke patients. In the absence of evidence from other lines of treatment, such as antidepressants or antiseptics, these drugs should be restricted to patients with acute stroke."
CD001257,There is no evidence EPA is effective for treating symptoms of schizophrenia. There is limited evidence EPA is effective for treating chronic pain. There is limited evidence EPA is effective for treating chronic pain.
CD001263,"Overall, the findings of this review demonstrated insufficient evidence to support a specific antibiotic regimen for the maintenance treatment of melioidosis. It was recommended that patients with mild to moderate melioidosis be offered entry into a clinical trial."
CD001281,"Theophylline appears to be superior to salmeterol in treating nocturnal asthma. However, there was no significant difference in the number of nights with an overnight fall in PEFR or less than 20%. Theophylline may be more harmful than salmeterol when used as a depot treatment. In patients with asthma without airways disease, theophylline appears to be superior to salmeterol in terms of efficacy. However, there was no significant difference in the number of nights with an overnight fall in PEFR or less than 20%."
CD001301,We found no evidence of difference in fertility outcomes between ICSI and conventional in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in women with non-male-factor infertility. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD001321,There is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any interventions for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTI) in people with neuropathic bladder following spinal cord injury.
CD001327,The use of antibiotics prophylactically before or after the insertion of an IUD is effective in reducing the rate of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and visits to the clinic for IUD-related issues. This results from a multicenter randomized controlled trial of women who had IUDs in their homes. The rate of infection was 31% lower with antibiotics in thetreated group compared to the placebo group. This result does not apply to non- antibiotics prophylactic before or after IUD insertion.
CD001333,"There is evidence that Naltrexone may be effective for preventing relapse to heroin addiction. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. Adverse events appear to be similar to placebo, although there may be a risk of perioperative drug-related adverse effects. The beneficial effects of Naltrexone appear to be modest compared to drugs such asoxyclavulanic acid or parenteral gold. It is not clear that the drug's effects on HIV are equally safe or effective."
CD001356,There is no evidence to suggest that surgical treatment of injuries to the ligaments of the knee is effective.
CD001366,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dietary advice for people with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on this topic.
CD001401,The two regimens used in this review are not statistically significant compared to control or other regimens. One regimen is not statistically significant compared to other regimens and the other is not statistically significant compared to other regimens. These results suggest that in patients with cystic fibrosis the effectiveness of positive expiratory pressure breathing is not significant.
CD001466,There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of any interventions for postural control in patients with cervical root compression.
CD001471,Psychotica is a term used to describe the development and evaluation of educational games for the revision of psychiatric disorders in a nurse training programme.
CD001496,There is evidence that antireflux therapy can improve pulmonary symptoms in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design.
CD001531,There is some indication that parents may be able to use their parenting experience to improve the pedestrian competence of children. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of instructor. More rigorous studies are needed to determine whether parents can use their parenting experience to improve the pedestrian competence of children.
CD001545,There is evidence that chemotherapy may prolong the survival of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer when used in combination with supportive care. This finding is based on randomised controlled trials in which patients are given chemotherapy in addition to supportive care. No evidence is available regarding the effect of chemotherapy on QoL in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer.
CD001546,There is no evidence of benefit of laparoscopic appendectomy compared to open appendectomy in patients with acute appendicitis. Patients with appendicitis wishing to have a laparoscopic appendectomy are advised to schedule a surgery.
CD001552,There is some indication that decompression may be more effective than injection of a local steroid in alleviating symptoms of CTS in patients with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD001704,There is some indication that physical therapy may be beneficial for patients with a trochanteric fracture of the femur. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD001706,There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of displaced subcapital fractures of the femur. Patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial.
CD001707,"There is no evidence of benefit from hemiarthroplasty for the prevention of displaced fracture of the subcapital femoral fracture. Patients with displaced fracture of the subcapital femur are more likely to experience pain, and complications. The risk of death is higher in the posterior approach, with a 10% mortality compared to the anterior approach."
CD001708,"There is evidence that THA is effective in reducing the risk of secondary displacement of the fracture. However, there is no evidence that the risk of death or disability is reduced. The data on hip complications and reinstatement procedures are not significant."
CD001717,The two depot neuroleptics found in most studies are more effective than fluspirilene. No significant differences were found in the effect on symptoms or in the side-effects. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences in effectiveness between depot neuroleptics.
CD001724,There is evidence that GTR with bioresorbable barrier membranes results in statistically significant and clinically important reductions in theDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth ofDepth of
CD001728,Steam inhalation may be useful for the treatment of symptoms of a cold. One trial found significant reductions in symptoms when treated withsteam in the first few days of treatment. Another trial found significant reductions in symptoms when treated withsteam in the first few days of treatment when the first few days of treatment are of unclear benefit. There is no evidence to suggest that steam inhalation reduces the rate of viral shedding.
CD001746,"There is evidence that a small number of interventions can be used in pediatric clinics to reduce exposure to tobacco smoke. The interventions appear to be effective in reducing ETS exposure in the following manner:ognitive behaviour change, increased abstinence, and response rates were all observed in the intervention groups. Adverse events were consistent with the intervention groups, although reasons for these were not discussed in the interviews. The evidence to date may justify the development and evaluation of a small number of interventions in this field."
CD001777,"There is evidence that the copper-coated IUDs are more effective than the plain-coated IUDs in preventing unintended pregnancies. However, the data on long-term effectiveness are not robust. This is because the copper sleeves are not routinely worn, and so may not be accurately identified by name. Further studies are needed to determine if the copper-coated IUDs are more effective than the plain-coated IUDs and, if so, which versions are superior and, if so, for how long."
CD001829,There is some indication that topical iced tea may be effective for the treatment of oral leukoplakia. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of treatment.
CD001843,"Urinary incontinence may be improved with early pelvic floor muscle exercise. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size, researchers at the University of Reading found that a six-week regimen of enhanced pelvic floor exercises begins immediately after RRP and accelerates continence. There was no significant difference in the rate of satisfaction with RRP or with the quality of life in the two groups."
CD001863,There is evidence that postpartum home visits are effective in reducing the rate of miscarriage and in decreasing the rate of infant mortality. These results apply to women in Syria but do not apply to the country as a whole. There is no evidence that postpartum home visits are effective in decreasing the rate of infant mortality or in decreasing the rate of breastfeeding.
CD001867,"Cognitive behavioural therapy may be as effective as oral naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, there is no evidence of effect from this therapy in preventing heavy drinking. There is no evidence of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy compared to oral naltrexone in preventing binge drinking."
CD001871,There is evidence that exercise can reduce television viewing and encourage more physical activity in children. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD001877,There is evidence that mammography reduces mortality and/or invasive breast cancer in women androgen receptor cell carcinomas. This evidence is not robustly replicated in other studies. There is no evidence that mammography reduces the risk of all-cause mortality or that it reduces the risk of all-cause mortality in women androgen receptor cell carcinoma.
CD001888,There is evidence that postoperative collection and transfusion of shed blood is effective in reducing the need for allogeneic transfusion of blood in patients undergoing total hip replacement. This finding may have implications for the design and practice of blood salvage.
CD001903,"The ketogenic diet appears to be effective in reducing seizure frequency in people with epilepsy. In comparisons with other diets, a significant advantage was seen for the diet with higher lipid: nonlipid ratios. However, most of the studies were of low methodological quality and small sample sizes. Further high quality and large sample sizes are required to assess the effectiveness of the diet in different people with epilepsy."
CD001914,Use of dietary supplements in children with cystic fibrosis is not associated with a significant change in their nutritional status. This finding is consistent with previous studies. There is no evidence that dietary supplements improve muscle strength in children with CF.
CD001929,There is evidence that manual therapy can reduce pain and improve function in people with chronic low back pain. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of treatment technique.
CD001950,"There is evidence that the benzoylecgonine antibiotic clonazepam may be effective for the treatment of akathisia. However, this data is not extrapolated to other clinical outcomes. There is no evidence that the drug is effective in preventing secondary akathisia."
CD001951,"Haloperidol may be an effective antipsychotic in treating acute schizophrenia. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of high doses of haloperidol in the treatment of acute schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia where plasma levels are of high significance, haloperidol may be effective at a low dose. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of high doses of haloperidol in the treatment of acute schizophrenia."
CD001972,"Candida colonization is frequently treated with topical agents. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical agents in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidosis. The most effective topical agents for candidiasis are fluconazole and amphotericin B. However, these agents are not routinely used in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidosis. Consequently, the evidence base is limited."
CD002011,There is evidence that exercise may be an effective substitute for postural drainage in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD002038,"The benefits of zidovudine alone in preventing disease progression and prolonging life are small and do not last long. A comparison of studies with combination regimens showed a significant benefit in mortality, in patients with advanced HIV infection and in patients with the Acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome, compared to zidovudine alone. This could be because the nucleotide donors in the combination regimens are fewer and less effective than those in the monotherapy regimens. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of combination therapy and the optimal regimens and to examine new therapies."
CD002058,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of systemic corticosteroids in preterm infants at risk for chronic lung disease. In the absence of evidence to support other lines of treatment, we recommend immediate administration of systemic corticosteroids to preterm infants at risk for CLD."
CD002119,"There is no evidence that spinal manipulation reduces pain or menstrual distress in women with primary dysmenorrhea. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown a reduction in pain and menstrual distress when spinal manipulation is used in a non-pharmacological manner. The evidence base is limited due to the small number of women included in the studies, the lack of detailed outcome measures that show the effects of spinal manipulation on outcomes such as pain and menstrual distress, and the lack of detailed outcome measures that show the effects of spinal manipulation on outcomes such as pain and"
CD002140,There is evidence that concurrent chemoradiotherapy may improve survival and local control in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer after two cycles of induction chemotherapy. The results suggest that the risk of death is lower in patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy compared to patients receiving radiotherapy alone. The evidence is not conclusive on the overall survival or local control.
CD002170,The beneficial effects of salbutamol on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are inconclusive because of the small number of participants and the small number of participants in the studies. A larger scale study of appropriate size is needed to determine whether the beneficial effects of salbutamol are attributable to specific inhalation devices or to individual devices.
CD002192,No evidence is available using oral anxiolytic medication for day-case surgery is effective.
CD002232,"No single intervention has been shown to be convincingly effective in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis. The update identified six new studies, most of them reporting on interventions not included in the original version. However, the conclusions of the review did not change."
CD002238,No specific evidence is available using imipramine in children with nocturnal enuresis to support bladder control. There is limited evidence using anticholinergics in this situation.
CD002248,There is evidence that relaxation training may be effective for alleviating pain and discomfort associated with primary dysmenorrhea. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of training methods.
CD002256,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy. In patients with acute pyelonephritis, therapy is effective in terms of cure rate, duration of hospitalisation and clinical response to therapy. However, the data on outcomes are sparse."
CD002261,"There is no evidence of efficacy or safety from the initial trial data of pramipexole in patients with Parkinson's disease. In comparisons with placebo, there was a statistically significant improvement for pramipexole in the time spent in ""off"" periods, decreased the severity of ""off"" periods, decreased disability and PD severity during ""on"" and ""off"" periods, as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale, and permitted a reduction in levodopa dosage. Adverse effects related to the central nervous system were similar to those reported with other dopamine agonists, and the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular tolerability of the"
CD002279,There is evidence that invert sugar may be beneficial for caries progression in preschool children. This finding is based on medium-term evidence.
CD002744,"Oseltamivir appears to be effective in reducing the duration and severity of influenza symptoms in children with asthma. In comparison to Tamiflu, it appears to be more effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in adults. However, there is no evidence that the drug reduces asthma exacerbations. In children, oseltamivir appears to be more effective in reducing the duration and severity of influenza symptoms than Tamiflu. However, there is no evidence that the drug reduces asthma exacerbations."
CD002751,There is evidence that active compression-decompression CPR may be effective in improving the survival and neurological prognosis of people in cardiac arrest. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD002759,"There is evidence that exercise training increases muscle strength, rate of force development and muscle activation in the muscles of people recovering from long-term disuse. This is based on randomised controlled trials."
CD002770,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. In patients with respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation may be effective in alleviating symptoms."
CD002771,There is evidence that kangaroo holding may be beneficial for the development of infants in hospital settings. This is based on randomised controlled trials in settings where mothers are already admitted and are involved in the care of newborn. There is no evidence that the benefits of kangaroo holding are limited to hospital settings.
CD002778,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of any interventions for temporomandibular disorders. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of patients included in the trials and the small number of participants. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to establish the effectiveness and effectiveness of any interventions for temporomandibular disorders."
CD002787,"There is evidence that HFOV improves lung recruitment in patients with acute hypoxaemia. It is unclear however, whether this translates to a reduction in mortality. Inhaled nitric oxide may increase the frequency of reversal of acute lung injury. However, there is no evidence that this will affect mortality."
CD002799,"There is some indication that HCC screening may reduce HCC mortality in people at increased risk. This could be because of better available information about HCC, which may make it easier to detect. More studies are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal frequency of HCC screening."
CD002829,There is no evidence that CoQ10 has any effect on the outcome of people with ALS. There is no evidence that CoQ10 has any effect on the quality of life of people with ALS. There is no evidence that CoQ10 has any effect on the quality of life of people with ALS.
CD002830,"There is no evidence of effect of haloperidol on outcomes in acutely agitated patients. In comparison to droperidol, the use of haloperidol appears to be less effective. No evidence of benefit or harm from haloperidol in the initial management of acutely agitated patients is available."
CD002863,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of metoprolol in the treatment of pregnancy induced hypertension. In patients with mild to moderate hypertension, metoprolol appears to be more effective than hydralazine. However, the data on neonatal outcomes are sparse and there is no evidence of a difference between groups. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness and effectiveness of metoprolol compared to other classes of medication in the treatment of pregnancy induced hypertension."
CD002900,"We found some small differences between MVA and EVA in the rate of satisfaction with the method of choice, the level of satisfaction with the method and the overall satisfaction with the study. These differences were not statistically significant and were not reported in the questionnaires. The evidence to date does not suggest a significant difference between MVA and EVA in the rate of satisfaction with the study and in the overall satisfaction with the study."
CD002918,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any interventions for chronic pain in adults with mild to moderate pain.
CD002923,No specific recommendations can be made for the first line treatment of acute psychosis with penfluridol. The drug should be offered to psychiatrists as a maintenance therapy.
CD002928,"There is some indication that controlled smoking plus partner support may be effective for reducing the number of cigarettes smoked, the nicotine content of cigarettes, and carbon monoxide levels in participants. However, these results are limited due to the small number of participants and the small number of outcomes included in the trials. Further controlled smoking plus partner support programs should be designed to provide more information about the outcome of the treatment to make sure that participants are not misled."
CD002929,There is some indication that wearing a mask may reduce the risk of infection during surgery. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD002943,There is evidence that email invitations can increase attendance at mammography screening. This is based on randomised controlled trials in which researchers gather data on the response of practice staff to email invitations for mammography screening. The results suggest that email invitations may be effective for increasing mammography uptake in areas with low uptake.
CD002969,There is some indication that psychotherapy may be useful for children and young adults with cancer. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD003046,"Radio-frequency ablation may be more effective than percutaneous microwave coagulation (PMC) in treating small nodules of HCC in patients with cirrhosis. However, the number of sessions per nodule is less in the RF ablation group than in the PMC group. This could be because the HCC tumors are smaller and the ablation technique is more complex. There is no evidence that HCC treatment with either RF or PMC has an increased risk of complications. The effectiveness and safety of radio-frequency ablation should be further examined in larger randomized trials."
CD003048,There is evidence that oral Lactobacillus GG accelerates recovery from acute watery diarrhoea in young children in a tropical setting.
CD003064,There is no evidence that oral furosemide reduces the time to hospital discharge or the length of hospitalisation for infants with transient tachypnoea. There is limited evidence that either frusemide or furosemide is effective in promoting resorption of lung fluid. This finding suggests that either frusemide is not effective in promoting resorption of lung fluid or that factors other than delayed resorption of this fluid contribute to the pathogenesis of TTN.
CD003076,"Treatment of deep-vein thrombosis with a single dose of enoxaparin in the outpatient setting is at least as effective and as well tolerated as treatment with unfractionated heparin. However, the once daily enoxaparin regimen is easier to administer (subcutaneous versus intravenous), does not require aPTT monitoring, and leads to both a reduced number of hospital admissions and an average 4-day-shorter hospital stay. In patients with proximal-vein thrombosis, treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin is feasible, effective, and safe"
CD003078,"There is evidence that the Y-set dialysis delivery system is effective in reducing peritonitis rates in CAPD patients caused by organisms derived from the commensal skin flora, principally coagulase-negative staphylococci, but does not reduce peritonitis caused by other organisms. This finding is consistent with previous evidence that the Y-set reduces incidence of peritonitis and exit site infection, but does not reduce the incidence of catheter exit wound infections."
CD003092,"There is evidence that vaginal prostaglandin E2 may be effective for induction of labour in women with a cervix that is not very favourable for childbirth. This finding is based on a small study of women at a maternity hospital in Zimbabwe. There is no evidence that the gel results in a significant reduction in the length of induction, the use of oxytocin or the incidence of cesarean section. These results apply to women who are undergoing induction of labour at a maternity hospital in Zimbabwe."

CD003175,"The use of adjuvant therapy for endometrial cancer is growing. There is evidence from one trial that it reduces mortality in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. However, there is no evidence that it reduces progression-free survival or that it reduces the risk of cancer-related death. The use of adjuvant therapy for endometrial cancer is growing. There is evidence that it reduces mortality"
CD003198,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of adjuvant therapy for depression.

CD003248,There is evidence that delayed cord clamping may be beneficial for preterm infants. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD003254,"There is evidence that antibiotic treatment of intra-amniotic infection during labour and immediately after cord clamping reduces the risk of neonatal sepsis and is associated with a shorter neonatal hospital stay and lower mean postpartum temperature than antibiotic treatment of immediate postpartum. However, there is no evidence that the antibiotic treatment of intra-amniotic infection following cord clamping is effective or not effective."
CD003265,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific urinary antiseptics for prevention of secondary peritonitis in women undergoing surgery for vaginal prolapse. There is a case for large randomized trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any adverse effects that might result from the use of urinary antiseptics.
CD003277,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effectiveness of lamotrigine in treating generalized seizures in people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
CD003283,"Loestrin, Triphasil and Ortho 10/11 are comparable in effectiveness and safety when used as contraceptive methods. No significant differences were found in contraceptive effectiveness or safety when used as a means of contraception."
CD003289,"School-based interventions for adolescent smoking are growing. There is some evidence that these interventions can reduce smoking rates. However, most of the studies were done in settings where there is little evidence of benefit for non-treatment-seeking adolescents. Further studies are needed to determine if there are differences between programmes and to determine whether there are differences between programmes and to determine whether these are clinically meaningful."
CD003296,"There is no high quality evidence that isotretinoin is effective for prevention of CIN2/3 in women with HIV-positive cervical dysplasia. There is a risk of toxicity from oral isotretinoin, which may explain why the trial results were not significant. In women with CIN2/3, isotretinoin appears to be equally effective as placebo. In women with CIN2/3, isotretinoin appears to be equally effective as placebo. The availability of isotretinoin in pill form is a major issue for the future of CIN2/3 treatment."
CD003303,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the relative effectiveness of optical devices compared to optical CCTVs in improving reading performance of patients with central vision. Patients with CCTVs are more likely to report experiencing eyewatering when reading, so these devices may be useful for short-term treatment of patients with CCTVs. The effectiveness of optical CCTVs may be improved with the introduction of more effective CCTVs."
CD003315,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific feeding technique for infants with unilateral cleft lip and palate. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of infants included in the studies and the small number of participants. Nevertheless, these data suggest that there is a need for a well-designed and well-designed intervention to support infants with unilateral cleft lip and palate in terms of their feeding technique, their weight, and their growth."
CD003317,There is evidence that electroacupuncture may be beneficial for the functional outcome of stroke patients. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of acupuncture sessions.
CD003318,There is limited evidence to support the use of any interventions to manage sexually transmitted infections in the context of a declining epidemic. Implementation of intervention programs must be conducted with caution due to the poor quality of the trials and the poor quality of the outcome measures.
CD003320,There is evidence that haematoma block is effective for pain relief in the upper radius. Manipulation of the distal radius is ineffective with the addition of hyaluronidase. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of high methodological rigour in order to define any benefit from the addition of hyaluronidase.
CD003384,"Topiramate may be as effective as antidepressants in treating bipolar disorder. There is no evidence of effect from two doses of topiramate in bipolar disorder. In addition, there is evidence of an anorexia in thetreated subjects. The drug may be useful as a prophylaxis in the event of a depressive episode. In addition, there is evidence of beneficial effects from topiramate in the treatment of bulimia."
CD003388,"There is evidence that exposure and cognitive restructuring, singly or combined, improve posttraumatic stress disorder markedly. Gains continued to 6-month follow-up and were significantly greater than the moderate improvement from relaxation."
CD003390,"There is evidence that folate supplementation, in either tablet or oral form, reduces plasma homocysteine and may reduce depressive symptoms in patients with major depression. This finding may justify the development and evaluation of folic acid as a antidepressant."
CD003401,There is evidence that CSE provides a comparable analgesia to EPID in women in early labour without a significant increase in the risk of motor block or side effects. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of analgesia.
CD003432,"There is inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of laparoscopic-assisted surgery in the treatment of non-metastatic colon cancer. In patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon, laparoscopic-assisted surgery is statistically significant in terms of OS, DFS, local recurrence and QoL. The incidence of death from any cause is also associated with LCR, although the results were not significant in the OC group. This update does not contain any new trials published in the journal colon cancer."
CD003439,"There is evidence that exposure to cigarette advertising at the point of sale is associated with higher uptake of smoking, initiation and smoking behaviour in youths. This is despite the fact that most of the studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s."
CD003452,"The bionator headgear combination appliance appears to be effective in correcting Class II, division 1 malocclusion. The results suggest that the appliance may be more effective than the Twin-block appliance in improving the quality of life of adolescents with Class II, division 1 malocclusion. The trade-off for use of the bionator headgear combination appliance is more appointments for appliance repair."

CD003487,There is evidence that feeding nasojejunal to preterm infants is effective in accelerating weight gain. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of feeding method. Poor quality evidence on the safety and effectiveness of feeding nasojejunal to preterm infants is also lacking.
CD003544,There is some indication that naloxone may be useful for the suppression of polydipsia in people with psychosis and hyponatremia. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design.
CD003546,Olanzapine may offer a clinically important improvement in sexual function in patients with schizophrenia. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm this.
CD003615,"No evidence was found comparing OXC with PHT in terms of safety, tolerability or effectiveness. The results suggest that OXC is more effective than PHT in treating partial seizures in adults with newly-diagnosed epilepsy. In addition, the results show that OXC has significant advantages over PHT in terms of tolerability and treatment retention."
CD003656,"There is evidence that exercise, diet and exercise, in combination with antihypertensive medication, is effective for reducing blood pressure in people with hypertension. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of intervention."

CD003719,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin-recombinant (rHCG) as a primary treatment for in vitro fertilisation. In women undergoing ICSI, rHCG appears to be equally effective as a primary treatment. Women who were undergoing ICSI were more likely to experience side-effects from the two treatments, which were similar in severity and frequency. The two trials were greatly underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between the two trials. Consequently, conclusions about the relative effectiveness of either recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin or"
CD003745,"Early indomethacin therapy appears to be ineffective for reducing the incidence of important shunts, the number of surgical ligations, and the duration of oxygen therapy in very low birth weight infants. This could be because the study participants were small and the data reported in the trials are not always reliable. More trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of indomethacin."
CD003797,"There is no evidence to suggest that the addition of any drugs to salbutamol alone provides a significant benefit in the treatment of acute asthma. In patients with moderately severe acute asthma, the most effective treatment is probably the combination of salbutamol and ipratropium. The beneficial effects of any drug to enhance the rate of response to treatment is probably the most effective treatment in patients with acute asthma."

It is desirable to conduct large randomized controlled trials in order to define the optimal dose and frequency of erythropoietin treatment in an anemic renal failure."
CD003901,"There is evidence that formoterol is more effective than albuterol in reducing symptoms of asthma in patients with moderate to severe asthma. However, there is no evidence that the drug is more effective than either terbutaline or placebo. This review underlines the urgent need for more evidence in the treatment of asthma."
CD003918,"Hydroxyurea may be a useful adjunct to radiation therapy in women with Stage IIIB cervical cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of radiation therapy in this manner. Women with Stage IIIB cervical cancer should be offered entry into a clinical trial of hydroxyurea in conjunction with radiation therapy."

CD003989,There is inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness and effectiveness of oral contraceptives in terms of menstrual control.
CD003993,"There is no evidence of effect of thymosin-alpha 1 in patients with advanced lung cancer. Patients treated with this treatment are more responsive than patients treated with vindesine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. However, most patients responded to vindesine-doxorubicin- and cisplatin-treated patients, and the response rate to these regimens was less than that seen in patients treated with thymosin-alpha1. This could be because the regimens were not equally effective or because the regimens were not equally effective or because the regimens were not equally"
CD004001,There is evidence that spinal cord stimulation may improve limb survival in patients with non-reconstructable critical leg ischaemia. The results suggest that SCS may reduce amputation levels in patients with severe inoperable leg ischaemia and be most effective in patients without arterial hypertension.

CD004329,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in improving survival in patients with NPC. In the absence of evidence from other trials, this review provides the only evidence to suggest that concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone in improving NPC survival."
CD004334,There is evidence that home safety inspections can significantly increase the use of safety restraints on children. This is based on medium-term studies in small studies in which parents and home visitors are both involved. The results suggest that home safety inspections can significantly increase the use of safety restraints on children.
CD004348,There is evidence that primary care physicians providing HIV-related care are more likely to be white and more likely to be male than are patients with other causes of HIV. This may explain why there is a small but significant difference in the use of health care services among people with HIV in different countries.
CD004374,There is evidence that postoperative catheter drainage is beneficial for urinary retention. The results suggest that in patients undergoing anterior colporrhaphy the risk of recatheterisation is less. In patients undergoing internal urethrotomy the risk of recatheterisation is higher.

The beneficial effects of oral antibiotics for preventing infection in patients with acute non-lysus leukemia need to be evaluated in large scale studies along with randomized controlled trials.
CD004389,"There is no high quality evidence that chloroquine is effective for preventing relapse of Plasmodium vivax malaria. In comparisons with low-dose primaquine, the results suggest that the chloroquine-based regimen is more effective in preventing relapse than the regimen containing chloroquine only. However, since both regimens are equally effective, there is no evidence that either regimen is effective for preventing relapse of Plasmodium vivax malaria. The effectiveness of the chloroquine-based regimen compared with the regimen containing no chloroquine is unclear."
CD004402,The two studies included in this review provide evidence that oral antiviral therapy can reduce the duration of symptoms of infectious mononucleosis without affecting the rate of immune cells that may be used to suppress the immune system. One study showed that corticosteroid therapy reduced symptoms of infectious mononucleosis when used short-term. There is no evidence that this effect can be attributed to the use of corticosteroid therapy alone.
CD004408,There is evidence that in the US involuntary outpatient commitment can reduce recidivism and length of hospital stay among people with severe mental illnesses. This finding is not corroborated by evidence from other studies. It is clear that in the US involuntary outpatient commitment can be harmful.
CD004416,"There is evidence that evening primrose oil may be effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In a review of studies including 23 studies, the authors found that the beneficial effects of evening primrose oil were consistent across studies. The results suggest that evening primrose oil may be effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis."
CD004423,"There is evidence that intake of preoperative water reduces nausea and vomiting and may reduce the risk of abdominal pain. However, there is no evidence that the intake of preoperative water reduces the risk of nausea and vomiting and may increase the risk of abdominal pain. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field."
CD004437,"There is evidence that streptokinase may be a useful treatment for acute pulmonary embolism. In patients with this disease, the risk of bleeding is high. However, the high frequency of bleeding observed in the streptokinase group suggests that patients should be carefully selected before thrombolytic therapy is given. The risk of death from pulmonary embolism in patients treated with streptokinase is low."
CD004439,"Oral quinolones are effective in the treatment of osteomyelitis when used in combination with other antibiotics. However, the data on quinolone-sensitive organisms is limited and further trials are needed."
CD004441,"There is evidence that tai chi can reduce the risk of injurious falls in people aged 65 years and older. The results suggest that in a safe community, tai chi can reduce the risk of serious injury. However, the results suggest that in a safe community, tai chi cannot reduce the risk of serious injury."
CD004450,"There is evidence that the oral iron chelator L1 is effective in reducing iron excretion in patients with transfusional iron overload. In comparisons with the two methods of administration, L1 was found to be more effective in reducing iron excretion than either Desferrioxamine or deferiprone. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal method of administration of L1 in patients with transfusional iron overload."

CD004458,There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of sinus irrigation in treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.
CD004464,There is evidence that sacral nerve stimulation may reduce the frequency of episodes of incontinence. This finding is based on a single trial that showed a significant improvement in FI during the ON versus OFF period. This finding is not corroborated by any evidence from other studies.
CD004479,"Although there is no agreement on the optimal treatment of patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the majority of physicians prefer chest tube drainage for air evacuation. Manual aspiration of air has been proposed by some, but lack of sound comparative data and safety data has limited its use. In this first randomized, prospective, multicenter pilot study, 60 patients with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax were randomly allocated to manual aspiration (n = 27) or chest tube drainage (n = 33). The results suggest that manual aspiration is more effective than chest tube drainage in evacuating primary spontaneous pneumothorax"
CD004522,There is evidence that thermal therapy may be useful in the rehabilitation of the knee after total knee arthroplasty. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of assessment.
CD004530,"There is no high quality evidence that azithromycin is superior to azithromycin alone for treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever. In patients with uncomplicated typhoid fever, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower mortality and lower adverse events than azithromycin alone. However, most patients with uncomplicated typhoid fever are not receiving azithromycin alone. This may explain why there is limited evidence for the use of azithromycin in the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever."
CD004544,"There is evidence that VBL is effective for prevention of first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. It is more effective than propranolol in reducing portal pressure. However, there is no evidence that VBL is more effective than beta-blocker therapy. In patients with cirrhosis without a prior bleed, VBL is more effective than propranolol. In patients with cirrhosis and high-risk esophageal varices, VBL is more effective than beta-blocker therapy. However, there is no evidence that VBL is more effective than beta-blocker therapy."
CD004559,There is some indication that Antiwei may be effective for treatment of influenza-like symptoms in adults. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. Adverse events appear to be similar for Antiwei and placebo. Further large studies are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of Antiwei.
CD004567,"There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin E for prevention of cataract.

CD004574,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of splint for the treatment of mallet finger.
CD004588,"There is inconclusive evidence for the outcomes of stenting in patients with CVD in the short term. Three-year survival rates without stroke and myocardial infarction are identical in both groups, and the cost/benefit ratio of stenting is determined primarily by the increasing need for revascularization in the PCI group. However, the respective repeat revascularization rates were 21.2% and 26.7% at 1 and 3 years in patients allocated to PCI, compared with 3.8% and 6.6% in patients allocated to CABG (P<0.0001). Diabetes (P<0."
CD004591,There is evidence that feeds containing lactase may enhance weight gain in preterm infants. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD004597,"There is evidence that omega-3 fatty acids, in particular the omega-3 fats contained in fish oil, may improve appetite and prolong survival in patients with cancer-associated wasting. However, there is no evidence that omega-3 fatty acids improve overall health or that they increase the risk of all-cause mortality. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. One correction for each inclusion and exclusion analysis in the included trials is required."
CD004602,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific oral medication for the relief of pain during surgery. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.

CD004621,"There is evidence that the use of a headgear to intercept the displacement of canines is effective in reducing the incidence of canine eruption. However, there is no evidence that the headgear reduces the time taken for canine eruption. The effectiveness of the headgear in preventing the displacement of canines is unclear at this time."
CD004631,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of a trapeziectomy for treating basal joint arthritis of the thumb. In patients with symptomatic thumbthritis, the technique of choice appears to be the same across all studies. There is no evidence for the efficacy of a technique of tendon interposition. In patients with symptomatic thumb arthritis, the technique of tendon interposition appears to be the same across all studies."
CD004635,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy in patients with endometriosis. When used in conjunction with other fertility treatments, GnRH may be beneficial for women with endometriosis who are not candidates for in vitro fertilisation. Women with severe endometriosis who are not candidates for in vitro fertilisation must continue with standard fertility treatments."
CD004655,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral cobalamin treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with megaloblastic anemia. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic.

CD004680,"There is some indication that the rate of infection and death for catheters placed peritoneoscopically is lower than for catheters placed open-sourced. This could be due to the smaller number of patients in the peritoneoscopic group, which may reduce the number of outliers. However, there is no evidence that the rate of infection or death for catheters placed peritoneoscopically is lower than for catheters placed open-sourced."
CD004727,There is no high quality evidence that HBO reduces mortality or length of hospital stay in burn patients. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of HBO in the treatment of burns.
CD004762,There is no evidence of effect of antidepressants on myotonia. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD004764,There is no evidence to suggest that eye patching reduces the pain of corneal abrasion. There is a risk of antibiotic-related side effects with eye patching. The risk of adverse effects on long-term health is higher with eye patching.

CD004796,"There is evidence that some therapies for infants with colic are effective. One study found significant reductions in crying, sleeping and required attention when treated with chiropractic spinal manipulation. Another showed significant improvement in the quality of life of infants with colic after chiropractic spinal manipulation. The results of this review confirm the need for large, double-blind studies on the effectiveness of chiropractic spinal manipulation on the pain profile of infants with colic."
CD004808,There is evidence that different contingency contracting policies can be used in different settings to alter the level of service offered to patients in order to achieve different outcomes. This information can be used to inform design of contingency contracting programs and to inform the selection of the terms of service.

There is limited evidence using citalopram as a treatment for adolescents with major depressive disorder.
CD004854,"There is some indication that psychoeducation may be effective for preventing relapse in patients with bipolar disorder. This could be because of the small sample size of the studies, which resulted in conclusions that were not always tractable. Further well designed and powered randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of sessions of psychoeducation in patients with bipolar disorder."
CD004864,"There is some indication that sodium bicarbonate may be beneficial for the survival and neurological outcomes of newborn infants in NICU. However, this evidence is limited due to the small number of infants studied and the small number of participants in the studies. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate in neonatal resuscitation and the outcome on neurological examination at discharge."

CD004886,The use of percutaneous therapeutic aspiration in the treatment of amebic liver abscess is growing. There is increasing evidence from clinical trials that aspiration results in a small clinically and statistically significant improvement in the rate of resolution of amebic liver abscess. This is based on a small study of only 42 patients.
CD004897,"There is evidence that high doses of sodium bicarbonate can be effective in treating patients with OP poisoning. However, the data on the rate of alkalinization of the blood after high doses of sodium bicarbonate did not show a significant effect on mortality. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large scale trials of high dose sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of patients with OP poisoning."
CD004898,"There is inconclusive evidence that selegiline is effective in treating early Parkinson's disease. In patients with early Parkinson's disease where dopamine antagonists are ineffective, selegiline may be considered in place of levodopa. The beneficial effects of selegiline on the progression of Parkinson's disease are modest and cannot be explained by changes in the disease. The beneficial effects of selegiline on the progression of Parkinson's disease are not clear."
CD004907,"There is evidence that active management of labour reduces the rate of cesarean section, length of labour and maternal satisfaction in women undergoing labour care in maternity care. This results from a meta-analysis of three randomised controlled trials: one in which women were randomly assigned to either active management or usual care, and one in which women were randomly assigned to either active management or usual care. The results of the trials suggest that there is no evidence that active management of labour reduces the rate of cesarean section, length of labour and maternal satisfaction in women undergoing labour care in maternity care."
CD004916,"There is some indication that atropine may be beneficial for myopia. A small study in the Netherlands showed a beneficial effect of atropine with multi-focal lenses on the rate of myopia progression. However, there was no significant effect of atropine with control lenses. There is no evidence that atropine is effective for preventing myopia."
CD004954,"There is evidence that air-treated patients are more likely to respond to treatment than those treated with HBO. This finding is consistent with previous evidence from randomized controlled trials and suggests that HBO may be beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke. The data on the effectiveness and safety of HBO are scarce due to the small number of patients included in the studies, the lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures and the small number of participants. Nevertheless it seems desirable to conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials on the topic."
CD004959,"There is evidence that tramadol is effective for the treatment of chronic low back pain. In comparisons with other opioids, tramadol showed a statistically significant advantage over placebo. However, most of the trials were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the long-term effects of tramadol in the treatment of chronic low back pain."
CD004976,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any specific type of drug for the treatment of acute rhinitis. Patients with a common cold should be offered a choice of oral antibiotics or a more effective treatment of choice.

CD005040,"Risperidone appears to be an effective antipsychotic in the treatment of autistic disorder. In children with autism, the evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the short follow-up. However, short-term treatment with a small dose (≥ 2.0 mg) of risperidone resulted in a 56.9 percent reduction in the Irritability score, compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in the placebo group. In children with autism, the evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the short follow-up. However, short-"

CD005064,There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of benzodiazepine treatment for the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
CD005103,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of adjuvant insulin in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. When used in combination with other means of insulin administration, such as systemic insulin or oral insulin, it is possible to achieve similar glycemic control. However, the data on microangiopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the small sizes of the studies. Further large-scale studies are needed to determine if there are differences between CSII and MI in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus and to examine whether there are differences between CS"

CD005287,"Raloxifene appears to have a small clinically and statistically significant benefit on the size and extent of uterine leiomyomas. In pre-menopausal women, the drug appears to be equally effective for the size and extent of leiomyomas as is leuprolide. In women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas, the drug appears to be equally effective as is leuprolide. A single trial is required to confirm the findings of this review."
CD005291,"There is some indication that preimplantation genetic screening may be beneficial for the quality of in vitro fertilisation. This is based on small studies in which researchers have only examined a small number of embryos. These studies confirm that in a small number of women, PGS may be beneficial for the quality of in vitro fertilisation. However, the evidence is not robust and further studies are needed."

CD005393,"There is evidence that Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is effective in reducing pain, length of stay and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy. Patients derive greater short-term benefits of reduced pain, shorter length of stay, and earlier resumption to work. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine whether these initial results are lasting."
CD005417,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of care-management approaches for home-based HIV/AIDS services. In the absence of evidence to support or refute other home-based HIV/AIDS services, these should be considered. More studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of care-management approaches compared to other home-based HIV/AIDS services and to determine whether or not these interventions are effective."
CD005451,"Tocainide appears to be similar to lidocaine in effectiveness and in effectiveness in the treatment of pain. However, the mechanism of action of the drug is unknown and side-effects are unknown. Given the high toxicity of lidocaine, it is not advisable to use the drug in this manner. Short-term treatment with a low dose of tocainide is indicated."

CD005482,"There is evidence that HAART can be stopped during treatment interruption. In a meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that the anti-HIV specific immune response is effective in preventing HIV replication. However, there is no evidence that the CTL response is effective in preventing HIV replication. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised trials of high methodological rigour in order to determine the effectiveness of HAART during treatment interruption."
CD005485,There is evidence that different pressure-relieving systems can be used with different mattress products. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.

CD005533,"Adding inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonists to a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), results in better clinical asthma control than increasing the dose of ICS. However, this approach may mask underlying airway inflammation. In a double-blind parallel-group study, we evaluated the effect of adding formoterol to a low dose of budesonide, compared with a higher dose of budesonide, on the composition of induced sputum. There was no significant difference between the groups in adverse effects or exacerbations of asthma, indicating that in this group of patients regular beta 2-agonist therapy"

CD005555,The benefits of lens extraction in patients with angle-closure glaucoma need to be evaluated at a long-term follow-up.
CD005556,"Topical NAC appears to be beneficial for the symptoms of blepharitis. The beneficial effects appear to be modest compared to drugs such as methotrexate or parenteral gold. NAC may be more effective than topical antibiotics because it inhibits lipid peroxidation. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of topical NAC in the era of antibiotics is indicated focusing on administration methods."
CD005565,"Corticosteroids are used for the treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adults. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of acute GVHD.

CD005571,"There is evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the risk of peristomal wound infection associated with PEG insertion. In the studies published so far, the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of peristomal wound infection has remained controversial. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of peristomal wound infection associated with PEG. During a 2-year-period a total of 347 patients (251 men, 96 women; mean age 60.2+/-5) were included in our study. In all cases, a 9-French gauge"
CD005576,"There is evidence that different saline solutions are used in different patients duringoperative procedures. In the abdominal aorta, the most common saline solution is HSL. This is because of the high concentration of HSL which reduces the risk of stroke and may reduce body weight. In the thoracic aorta, the most common saline solution is LR. There is no evidence that the amount of HSL or LR administered is different in each group."
CD005640,"Primary closure of the common bile duct is more effective and more effective than T-tube drainage in alleviating symptoms of bacteremia and intestinal peritonitis in patients with choledocholithiasis. However, there is no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of death or hospital stay after primary closure compared to T-tube. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in settings where there is a high mortality rate and long-term complications."
CD005653,Topiramate appears to be an effective treatment for anger in women with borderline personality disorder. The results suggest that significant weight loss can be expected.
CD005963,"Use of advance directives for people with serious mental illness is growing. There is some indication that directives may reduce the use of inpatient services and use of the Mental Health Act. However, this is based on only a small number of patients. There is no evidence that directives that refer to the need for more care are effective."
CD005968,"There is evidence that immediate or delayed placement of an implant into an extraction site is associated with a small reduction in hard tissue response. However, this may be reduced if the implant is placed in the extraction site. The decision to use either method must consider the movement of the facial gingival margin, which, in a critical esthetic patient may require soft tissue support from a provisional restoration or similar type of anatomical healing abutment."
CD006001,There is evidence that preoperative biliary drainage may be useful in the treatment of obstructive jaundice in patients with pancreatic head carcinoma. This finding should be interpreted with caution in settings where there is a high risk of infection.
CD006014,There is evidence that secondary cytoreductive surgery reduces the risk of death and overall survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This finding is consistent with previous evidence that the risk of death is reduced after secondary cytoreductive surgery.

CD006063,"The two trials included in this review provide evidence that metformin-glibenclamide tablets are effective in reducing fasting and plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of metformin-glibenclamide on lipid profile, pancreatic enzymes or pancreatic acid. The trials included in this review are not suitable for very high quality controlled trials. Future trials should attempt to stratify patients and perform intention-to-treat analysis to allow better external validity."

CD006075,There is evidence that exercise designed for people with a significant walking deficit is effective in improving muscle strength and speed in the first year post stroke. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of exercises.
CD006089,"Antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis-like complaints in general practice. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend antibiotic therapy for the resolution of facial pain and the resumption of daily activities in patients with acute sinusitis-like complaints. Patients with acute sinusitis-like complaints are often treated with antibiotics in spite of the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy and the increasing number of resistant strains."
CD006103,"The benefits of varenicline for smoking cessation were consistent across studies, with statistically significant results for both abstinence and rate of continuation. Adverse events were similar to placebo, with less nausea and less substance-related adverse events, although these were not insignificant. Varenicline appeared to be similar to placebo in terms of overall effectiveness and safety, with a lower incidence of serious adverse events than did placebo. However, there were no significant differences in motivation to stop smoking or withdrawal symptoms. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality to define the effectiveness and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation."
CD006105,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. Appropriately designed large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to determine the effects of metformin in women with PCOS undergoing ovarian stimulation.
CD006120,There is evidence that cocaine may provide pain relief during laser vaporization of the cervix in women undergoing large loop excision of the transformation zone of the cervix. This finding is inconsistent with previous evidence that CIN causes more pain than any other local anaesthetic. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal local anaesthetic combination for CIN.
CD006140,Naltrexone is an oral drug that can be administered in a capsule or intramuscular form. It is possible that it may be possible to implant a small number of naltrexone capsules or intramuscular form in people with opiate dependence. The risk of overdose after naltrexone implantation is low. Studies identifying the most effective naltrexone implants are needed.
CD006154,There is evidence that orthotics are effective for treating pain in people with cavus feet.
CD006179,There is evidence that prophylaxis with antibiotics is effective for prevention of catheter-related infections in neonates with central venous catheters. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of antibiotic choice.
CD006182,"Primary peritoneal drainage is ineffective as either a temporising measure or definitive treatment in preterm infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis. In the absence of evidence of beneficial effects of peritoneal drainage on long-term outcomes, mortality and dependency on parenteral nutrition should beLeft untouched the choice of laparotomy or primary peritoneal drainage."
CD006187,"There is evidence that very early rehabilitation, especially in the first 24 hours after stroke, may be effective for improving outcomes after stroke. However, the evidence is limited due to the small number of patients included in the trials, the heterogeneity of the intervention or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of VEM in patients with stroke."
CD006188,"There is some indication that progressive pain may be improved with the use of a more widely available and more effective type of prosthesis. However, this is not evidence from a single study. There is no evidence that the use of a more widely available and more effective type of prosthesis has improved the rate of survivorship of shoulders with RA."
CD006201,"There is no evidence of efficacy or effectiveness of melarsoprol as a treatment for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. In comparison to nifurtimox, a comparator treatment, melarsoprol appeared to be more effective in treating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. However, the data on adverse events were not significant. The effectiveness and safety of melarsoprol as a treatment for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense needs to be evaluated in large scale studies."
CD006212,"There is evidence that filters are effective in reducing the risk of pulmonary embolism and in decreasing the risk of deep-vein thrombosis in patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis. However, there is no evidence that filters are effective in preventing postthrombotic syndrome. These results apply to patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis or those with a suspected prior pulmonary embolism. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials and the small number of participants in the trials. Therefore these results should be interpreted with caution until further evidence"
CD006213,"There is inconclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of the Limberg flap technique in treating chronic pilonidal sinus. In patients with chronic pilonidal disease, the flap may offer a significant improvement in pain perception, time to healing and return to normal activity. However, most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is required."
CD006225,"There is no evidence that catheters differ in effectiveness or effectiveness in the outcome of IUI. The use of either the Gynetics or Makler catheters is associated with similar IUI results in terms of pregnancy and pregnancy rate. However, there is no evidence that these results apply to non- IUI couples. This is based on small studies in sparsely populated settings."
CD006244,There is evidence that nurse-led epilepsy clinics can improve the quality of care of patients with epilepsy in general practice. This conclusion is limited by the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the clinics and the small number of studies included in the review.
CD006247,"There is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of a low-bacterial diet in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. When used in conjunction with other infection prevention measures, it may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on the topic."
CD006254,"Cinacalcet HCl appears to be effective in reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. In patients with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, cinacalcet HCl appears to be effective in reducing PTH, calcium, and phosphorus. The most common side effects, nausea and vomiting, were usually mild to moderate in severity and transient. Cinacalcet offers a new therapeutic option for controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis."
CD006269,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of hyperthermia in the treatment of primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum. In the absence of evidence from other lines of treatment, this recommendation must be interpreted with caution."
CD006325,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of intra-arterial CDP in the treatment of primary osteosarcoma. When used in this manner, it may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic."
CD006331,"There is some indication that intermittent pneumatic compression may be useful for the restoration of sensory function in stroke patients. The evidence is limited due to the small number of patients included in the trials, the heterogeneity of the treatment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop a treatment for intermittent pneumatic compression in stroke patients."
CD006344,"There is some indication that a small pilot study of some sort may have improved asthma outcomes in children with asthma after IHCWs provided some introductory asthma education. This could be because the students were more willing to share their experiences with IHCWs, and therefore more willing to share their experiences with me. This could be a useful tool for large-scale randomized controlled trials of any kind."
CD006429,"There is evidence that oxygen, when given in both oxygen and non-oxygenated form, reduces dyspnea and time spent on exercise in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The benefits appear to be modest compared to the benefits of air or compressed air. Studies identifying the most effective oxygen mixture are needed."
CD006459,"There is evidence that neurostimulation can improve the execution of popliteal sciatic nerve blocks. In a multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size, moderate quality and length, we found evidence that neurostimulation improved the execution of popliteal sciatic nerve blocks."
CD006483,There is evidence that computer-delivered HIV/AIDS risk reduction interventions are effective in increasing HIV/AIDS preventive behaviors. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of intervention method.
CD006525,There is some indication that collaborative care may be effective for improving treatment of depression in primary care. This is based on small studies in two countries.
CD006559,"Urinary catheter care is a major area of infection control in intensive care units. There is evidence that ICLNs can reduce the incidence of VAP. Further studies are needed to determine if the ICLNs reduce VAP incidence and if so, at what rate and in what settings."
CD006569,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of aripiprazole as a treatment for acute schizophrenia. In patients with acute schizophrenia, aripiprazole appears to be similar to olanzapine in terms of efficacy, tolerability and adverse events. However, patients with acute schizophrenia may be more likely to experience serious adverse events if aripiprazole is prescribed. This could explain why the drug has a lower incidence of adverse events than olanzapine."
CD006576,"There is evidence that short-term prophylaxis is effective in preventing the development of urinary tract infection (UTI) and in reducing the risk of serious adverse outcomes from transrectal prostatic biopsy. However, there is no evidence that long-term prophylaxis is effective in preventing anaerobic bacteriuria or in reducing the risk of serious adverse outcomes from transrectal prostatic biopsy. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Therefore, these data should be interpreted with caution until further evidence becomes available."
CD006579,There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies cancer. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies cancer. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies cancer.
CD006581,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of any specific lidocaine solution for local anaesthesia in eyelid surgery. When used in this manner, the solution may be associated with a lower pain score than the plain solution and therefore should be restricted to patients with high pain scores. Further adequately powered randomised controlled trials should be conducted in eyelid surgery settings that would include multiple patients and carefully chosen outcome measures."
CD006591,There is evidence that different approaches to increasing uptake of medication for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection in adolescents can be used with varying effectiveness.
CD006613,There is evidence that blood transfusion can reduce the risk of re-bleeding in patients with acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. This finding is based on randomised controlled trials. No evidence was found that the risk of death was increased or decreased after blood transfusion.
CD006643,"Interferon beta-Ib appears to be beneficial for people with primary progressive MS. However, there is insufficient evidence from other trials and further research is needed."
CD006687,The two studies included in this review did not allow conclusions about the effect of SSRIs in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. One study showed a significant benefit for patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon when SSRIs were given in the form of oral medication. The other study showed a significant benefit for patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon when SSRIs were given in the form of oral medication.
CD006703,There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of palatal closure surgery in patients with submucous cleft palate. The treatment of this malformation is indicated only when evidence is available of velopharyngeal insufficiency.
CD006780,"There is evidence that heparin reduces the risk of early onset of preeclampsia, of negative outcomes such as uterine bleeding and of chromosomal abnormalities. It may be advisable to carry out large randomised controlled trials on the use of heparin for prevention of placental-mediated complications of pregnancy in women without thrombophilia."
CD006801,"There is evidence that orthoses can reduce pain, improve function and improve child health-related quality of life in people with arthritis. However, there is no evidence that orthoses are effective in treating plantar fasciitis."
CD006854,This review provides some evidence to show that there is a role for visual feedback in the treatment of misarticulation in patients with cleft palate.
CD006857,"At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific antibiotic therapy for treatment of upper urinary tract infection in children. Short-term data are needed to determine the effectiveness of single-dose antibiotic therapy compared to a five-day course of treatment with a newer antibiotic."
CD006860,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of domiciliary care programs. They may have some small effects on the quality of life of people with disabilities.
CD006884,There is evidence that methotrexate may be effective in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn's disease. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design.
CD006893,"Infliximab is effective in treating Crohn's disease with a short term effect on clinical response and a longer term effect on response. However, the long term effect on response and remission is not clear. Infliximab may be more effective in preventing the formation of perianal fistulas than placebo. However, the long term effect on response and remission is not clear."
CD006900,There is no evidence to suggest that the use of hCG-triggered ovulation therapy improves pregnancy outcomes or other outcomes in women with anovulation. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of hCG-triggered ovulation in women with anovulation.
CD006914,There is some indication that music therapy may be beneficial for women undergoing cesarean delivery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed studies on the topic.
CD006919,"There is evidence that GnRH agonists are effective in preventing LH surges in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation. However, the long-term safety and effectiveness of the drugs is still unknown. Certain women may be more likely to miscarry if GnRH agonists are not used. Further long-term safety and effectiveness data are required."
CD006921,There is no evidence that oral steroids are superior to IV methylprednisolone in treating acute relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis. The most optimistic outcome for oral steroids is an average benefit of less than half a grade improvement on the Hauser's Ambulatory Index at week 4. This suggests that the amount of absorbed corticosteroid is similar after either steroid at these doses.
CD006955,There is some indication that ergonomic interventions may be useful for workers with musculoskeletal-related absenteeism. This review underlines the urgent need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD006971,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of gel-based cervical ripening in preventing cesarean section. In patients with an unfavourable cervix, gel-based ripening appears to be less effective than manual ripening. In women with an amenorrhea, gel-based ripening appears to be more effective than manual ripening. These results apply to women with an unfavourable cervix or those who are undergoing induction."
CD006981,There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of toxin for sialorrhea in patients with ALS. This decision must be preceded by conducting randomized controlled trials.
CD006989,"There is evidence that H1-antihistamine + intranasal glucocorticosteroids is effective for treatment of moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, this finding needs to be confirmed in larger series studies."
CD007004,"Current evidence does not demonstrate a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, or in the rate of renal progression, when patients are treated with spironolactone. This could be because the drug is a non-opioid treatment, and there is no evidence of a benefit in long-term renal function. Conversely, aldosterone antagonists may have a beneficial effect on renal function, because aldosterone is an aldosterone-receptor antagonist and may have beneficial effects in long-term renal function. However, there is no evidence of beneficial effects on long-term renal function when patients are treated with ald"
CD007016,"Despite most of the included studies being of low quality, the results suggest that peritoneal dialysis is an effective therapy for acute renal failure in developing countries."
CD007031,"There is evidence that CIC/FP is more effective than salmeterol/ampicosteroids in treating asthma. However, there is no evidence that it is more effective thanfp when used in patients with moderate persistent asthma. The evidence is limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies, the lack of detailed outcome data or the lack of detailed outcome data that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. These results should make it difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of CIC/FP in treating asthma."
CD007079,"calcium supplementation, especially in the form of calcium carbonate, is an effective means of decreasing maternal blood lead levels and decreasing the risk of preterm delivery and neonatal mortality in women who are deficient in calcium. However, there is insufficient information about other outcomes and side-effects that may result from the use of calcium. Consequently, these data should be interpreted with caution until further evidence is available. More rigorous randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effects of calcium supplementation on preterm delivery and neonatal mortality."
CD007119,There is evidence that low-dose urokinase infusions can restore function to the majority of catheters occluded by fibrin sleeves. Adding heparin to the urokinase infusions does not enhance the efficacy of the infusions. The restored function often persists until the VADs are removed.
CD007145,"The NELLI trial data suggest that exercise, especially aerobic training, is effective in reducing the risk of GDM in pregnant women. It also suggests that exercise may be effective in reducing the risk of early-term adverse consequences of GDM. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures."
CD007176,"There is some indication that vitamin C supplementation may reduce the risk of CVD events in people with esophageal dysplasia. However, there is no evidence that this effect is attributable to vitamin C alone. There is some indication that vitamin C supplementation may reduce the risk of CVD events in people with esophageal dysplasia. However, this is not evidence that it is attributable to vitamin C alone."
CD007189,Oral HIV prevention drugs administered to men who have sex with men or transgender women are effective in preventing HIV infection. A multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to confirm these findings.
CD007196,"Early cholecystectomy, whether inactivated or not, appears to be the most effective treatment for acute gallbladder disease. However, many of the patients studied in this review had already undergone earlier cholecystectomy and therefore may not be eligible for early intervention. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness and safety of early cholecystectomy and to examine whether it is better than open cholecystectomy in patients with acute gallbladder disease."
CD007202,"The use of pacifiers is associated with a number of outcomes that may have implications for breastfeeding, including lower frequency of exclusive breastfeeding, and length of breastfeeding. However, there is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of pacifier use at a particular stage of life. This may explain why there is limited evidence to support or refute the use of pacifiers at a particular stage of life."
CD007204,There is some indication that dronabinol may be a useful treatment for anorexia in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design.
CD007230,"There is evidence that edaravone may be a useful neuroprotective agent in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design. Adverse events appear to be similar to placebo, although immunogenicity may be an issue. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this study and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of edaravone."
CD007235,"There is evidence that antenatal corticosteroids can be inappropriate for women with threatened preterm labour. This is because they may not be effective for preventing the formation of a protective membrane which, if breached, could lead to the risk of a preterm labour. Women with threatened preterm labour should be offered weekly ultrasound of the cervix."
CD007253,The administration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists is associated with improvements in cognitive function in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The administration of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists and antagonists is associated with improvements in cognitive function in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
CD007271,"Early tracheotomy is more effective than delayed tracheotomy in reducing the incidence of pneumonia, mortality and accidental extubation in patients requiring prolonged ventilation. However, there is no evidence of a reduction in the number of days spent in the intensive care unit or in hospital. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials of high methodological quality in order to define the optimal timing of tracheotomy in patients requiring prolonged ventilation."
CD007287,"There is no evidence that oregovomab is effective for treating ovarian cancer. In patients with ovarian cancer who are not receiving chemotherapy, oregovomab is effective in terms of time to relapse and progression-free interval. However, patients with ovarian cancer who are receiving chemotherapy and who are not receiving oregovomab are likely to experience some adverse effects. These results do not exclude the possibility that oregovomab may be effective in treating ovarian cancer."
CD007295,"There is evidence that the antidepressant paroxetine may be effective for people with MS and MDD. In a review of available evidence, the authors of the review found no evidence of a significant effect of the drug on long term outcomes."
CD007302,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that VGB is effective as an add-on therapy to antiepileptic therapy for partial seizures in patients with epilepsy. The data suggest that in a sample size of 350 patients, VGB resulted in a 42% and 42% reduction in seizure frequency, respectively, compared to placebo. This results suggest that in a sample size of 350 patients, VGB is more effective than placebo in reducing seizure frequency."
CD007303,"There is evidence that erythropoietin can improve the quality of life of anemic cancer patients receiving cyclic, cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. However, there is no evidence that the results observed in this review apply to anemic cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The results suggest that the anemia outcomes in anemic cancer patients receiving cyclic, cisplatin-containing chemotherapy are not adequately investigated to support the use of erythropoietin."
CD007360,There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of antagonists in the treatment of LUTS with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
CD007388,"Only loading dose of magnesium sulfate appears to be effective in controlling convulsion in patients with eclampsia. This could be because the anticonvulsant is more effective than a standard regime of magnesium sulfate. However, there was no evidence from the trials on other parameters such as mortality or return of consciousness. This could explain why there is limited evidence for other outcomes in these trials."
CD007440,"The drug is effective in reducing pain after meniscectomy, when pain is severe and when pain is moderate. It is not clear that it is effective in acute pain following surgery. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies pain. Studies identifying the most effective drug are needed."
CD007444,There is evidence that nitric oxide donors may be effective for accelerating the rate of cervical ripening before surgical termination of pregnancy. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of donor agents.
CD007468,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the current treatment strategy of palliative care for patients with Bell's palsy.
CD007539,"Presently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of anti-histamines for prevention of blood transfusion febrile reactions. These reactions can be serious and can lead to serious bleeding. Consequently, it is important to carry out large randomised controlled trials on the topic."
CD007550,"There is evidence that ibuprofen is an effectiveNSAID. In clinical trials, the S(+)-isomer of the drug produces statistically significant and clinically important analgesia. This is based on medium-term evidence. No studies have compared S(+)-ibuprofen with racemic ibuprofen, which is more active and has a similar analgesia profile. The availability of studies of high methodological rigour is needed to assess the effectiveness of S(+)-ibuprofen compared to other classes of ibuprofen, including non-S(+)-ibuprofen,standard ibup"
CD007557,There is evidence that immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. This is based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials including 42 studies including 4213 patients. The results suggest that HIT is associated with an increased risk of death and that there is a 10% increase in the risk of serious adverse outcomes from immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. These results suggest that HIT is associated with an increased risk of death and that there is a 10% increase in the risk of serious adverse outcomes from immune hepar
CD007570,"There is evidence that PEG + E is effective for the treatment of constipation in children. It is significantly more effective than lactulose as maintenance therapy, both in efficacy in treating constipation and in preventing the recurrence of faecal impaction. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of laxative."
CD007583,There is inconclusive evidence for a beneficial effect of postoperative radiotherapy in women with Stage IB cervical cancer who are undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. This could be because the tumors are small and there is no way to know whether the radiation dose is safe or not. This could explain why there is no evidence for a benefit of postoperative radiotherapy in women with stage Ib cervical cancer who are undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.
CD007584,There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific type of adjuvant therapy for MOGCT. Patients with MOGCT can be offered entry into the parenteral gold line at a discount. The risk of recurrence is low. Patients with MOGCT can be offered entry into the parenteral gold line at a discount.
CD007592,"A single dose of fluoride tablet (FLUDENT) is ineffective for preventing caries. A single dose of fluoride tablet (FLUDENT) is ineffective for preventing caries. Both tablets and solutions containing fluoride are effective for preventing caries. However, there is no evidence of effect of topical fluoride on total caries increment."
CD007624,There is evidence that physical therapy can improve the recovery of hip fracture patients. This finding is based on a small study of modest methodological rigour.
CD007629,There is evidence that ischemic preconditioning protects the liver against ischemia-reperfusion injury when performed under continuous clamping of the portal triad. This maneuver does not improve postoperative liver function and does not affect morbidity or mortality. The clinical use of IP through 10 minutes of warm ischemia is not currently recommended.
CD007632,There is evidence that IPC reduces blood loss during liver resection in patients with cirrhosis. This finding is consistent with previous studies and should be used as a basis for deciding the optimal clamp/release regime for intermittent portal clamping.
CD007635,"There is evidence that a multimodal approach to postoperative care is effective in reducing the rate of complications and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing colonic resection. This is based on randomised controlled trials in which patients are given a choice between regimens that differ in terms of: fluid restriction, prokinetic agents, early ambulation, and a fixed dose of epidural analgesia. The results suggest that in a given population of patients, a multimodal approach is effective in reducing postoperative complications and length of hospital stay."
CD007641,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of ""Eat Well with CF"" as a form of nutritional support in adults with CF. It may be useful to develop a tailored program for adults with CF."
CD007649,"There is evidence that CDP870 may be beneficial for patients with RA. In a review of the current evidence, the authors of the review found that the anti-TNF-alpha component of CDP870 appears to be beneficial for patients with RA. The review identified four new studies that should be undertaken in the coming months."
CD007655,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of furosemide-reserpine as a treatment for essential hypertension. When used in combination with other drugs, it may be advisable to carry out large randomised clinical trials on this topic."
CD007667,"There is evidence that phenytoin may be effective for people with impulsive aggression. In a review of randomized controlled trials including 42 studies, moderate quality evidence suggests that the drug reduces the frequency of impulsive-aggressive outbursts and may reduce the severity of these outbursts. The review identified six studies, most of them reporting on interventions that have been shown to have effects on impulsive-aggressive behaviour. However, the data were not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the use of phenytoin in the treatment of impulsive aggression."
CD007675,"There is evidence that some interventions designed for men are effective in terms of weight loss. However, most of the studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes. The evidence produced by this review is not adequate to make specific recommendations regarding the design of intervention or the provision of specific support."
CD007679,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and safety of LASIK in correcting myopia. In comparisons with other refractive procedures, the results were consistent. LASIK was more effective than no lens at all time periods studied, and was more effective than a lens exchanged for a larger optic diameter. However, most of the comparisons were not of high methodological quality and further research is needed."
CD007749,"There is no evidence of benefit of antioxidant therapy in treating acute hepatitis. In patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, antioxidant therapy appears to be ineffective. Patients with acute hepatitis are more likely to experience liver failure if they are not on antioxidant therapy. The results of this review confirm the inconclusive findings of the previous reviews."
CD007775,There is evidence that buprenorphine is effective for the maintenance treatment of opium dependence. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of dosage.
CD007815,"There is evidence that quetiapine may be an effective antipsychotic in the treatment of schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, the drug showed a statistically significant benefit over the non- quetiapine alternative haloperidol. This could be because the newer antipsychotic compounds have fewer side effects and are less likely to cause harm. However, these data should be interpreted with caution until further evidence is established."
CD007830,"There is some indication that treadmill training may be beneficial for people with early Parkinson's disease. In a review of small randomised controlled trials including 42 patients, significant improvements were seen in lower-extremity tasks in people with early Parkinson's disease. The results suggest that treadmill training may be beneficial for people with early Parkinson's disease."
CD007842,"There is evidence that atropine alone may be effective for myopia control in children. However, there is no evidence that it reduces myopia progression. A combined therapy using auricular acupoints enhances lower-level atropine eyedrops when used for myopia control. The result was an effect almost equal to that of 0.5% atropine alone. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD007851,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of augmentation therapy for alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency in patients with emphysema. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD007857,"There is evidence that iron supplementation, especially iron infusion, is effective in reducing the risk of serious adverse effects on patients with CKD. The effectiveness of iron supplementation, especially iron infusion, is less clear in patients with CKD. The proportion of patients achieving the primary outcome (Hb increase > or =1 g/dL) was greater in the IV iron treatment group than in the oral iron treatment group (44.3% vs. 28.0%, P= 0.0344), as was the mean increase in Hb by day 42 (0.7 vs. 0.4 g/dL, P= 0."
CD007859,"There is evidence that archwires are effective in alleviating crowding of the anterior mandibular dentition. However, there is no evidence that the wires are superior to non-archwires in alleviating this problem. The lack of evidence from trials on the effectiveness of archwires is due to the small number of participants in each trial, the lack of standardisation in the choice of trial design or the lack of detailed outcome data that make it difficult to make comparisons across studies. There is evidence that the super-elastic archwire is superior to the non-Elastic archwire in alleviating crowding of the"
CD007877,"There is no evidence that rFVIIa is associated with an increase in mortality, in terms of number of days spent in intensive care or in the neonatal intensive care unit, or that it is associated with a significant increase in thromboembolic events. The potential benefits of rFVIIa for bleeding refractory patients with trauma cannot be ruled out, but further research is needed."
CD007921,"There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of adjuvant bypass grafting with a distal vein cuff in improving limb salvage rates in patients with ischaemia. This is based on randomised controlled trials in which at least one graft is used. The results suggest that in most patients, adjuvant bypass grafting with a distal vein cuff does not improve the patency of a PTFE bypass."
CD007954,"The two studies included in this review provide evidence that Limbitrol is effective in the treatment of primary depression. In comparisons with placebo, a statistically significant effect was seen in the first week of treatment, which was not the case in the other two studies. This could be because the drug has a ""quiet"" effect that may make it less likely to cause side effects. The two studies included in this review provide evidence that Limbitrol is effective in the treatment of primary depression. In comparisons with other antidepressants, a statistically significant effect was seen in the first week of treatment in the second study and not in the other studies. This could"
CD007960,There is no evidence to support the effectiveness of gabapentin in the treatment of tinnitus.
CD007987,"The intervention showed some small benefits for parents with intellectual disability. It improved parents' health behaviours, increased their knowledge of home dangers, and resulted in a significant increase in the number of safety precautions parents implemented in their homes. However, all gains were maintained at 3 months post-intervention. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials on home-based interventions to support parents with intellectual disability in promoting their children's health and home safety."
CD007990,"There is evidence that psychostimulant therapy can reduce tic disorder symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD and chronic tic disorder. However, the data on tic disorder and ADHD are scarce and further research is needed."
CD008007,"Lycopene is an antioxidant that has some theoretical advantages over other antioxidant treatments, but currently there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of lycopene for prevention of prostate cancer. With the current evidence available, lycopene appears to be an effective antioxidant for prevention of prostate cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of lycopene for prevention of prostate cancer. Where possible, men should be offered entry into a clinical trial to determine if lycopene supplementation reduces serum PSA, which is a surrogate endpoint for prostate cancer initiation or progression."
CD008016,"Most patients with early episode schizophrenia are not treated with medication for 6 months or more. However, a small number are treated with medication for 6 months or more, and the rate of improvement is not significant."
CD008037,"There is evidence that vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections in patients with CF. However, there is no evidence that vitamin D supplementation is effective in decreasing the number of days of antibiotics used to treat RTIs in children with CF. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the current study and the lack of detailed outcome data that make it difficult to make confident assessments of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical parameters in patients with CF."
CD008054,"There is evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is effective in detecting high-grade cervical disease. In comparison to adjunct testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) status, the human papillomavirus DNA testing is more accurate but associated with a greater loss to follow-up. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of testing methods."
CD008084,"There is evidence that corticosteroids can be used in the treatment of patients with severe paraquat poisoning. The evidence is limited due to the small number of patients studied and the small number of participants in the trials. However, it is clear that Corticosteroids can be used in the treatment of paraquat poisoning."
CD008148,Corticosteroids are used for treating HELLP in some studies but data on their effectiveness in differentiating between groups and in differentiating between them is lacking. One trial showed significant benefit of long-term corticosteroids in the treatment of HELLP in women with antepartum or postpartum HELLP. Another trial showed significant benefit of corticosteroids in the treatment of HELLP in women with antepartum or postpartum HELLP. These studies were not statistically significant or significant enough to recommend a specific type of corticosteroids in the treatment of HELLP. Future trials should attempt to
CD008152,"There is evidence that artesunate alone may be effective for clearing submicroscopic parasites from patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, there is no evidence that it clears gametocytes that persist after treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate. This could explain why there is limited evidence for use of artesunate in clear and effective treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria."
CD008169,"There is some evidence that the anti-hypertensive drugs spironolactone and cefpodoxime may have benefits on blood pressure. However, the data are not significant and further research is needed."
CD008228,There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of alleviated positioning after small macular hole surgery. This review provides some evidence to show that the success rate of vitrectomy is not significantly reduced if facedown positioning is replaced by simply taking care to avoid the supine position.
CD008233,There is evidence that macrolides may be effective for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. This evidence is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD008237,There is evidence that simulator training can be used to significantly shorten the learning curve for new endoscopists performing colonoscopy. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures. It is not clear that the simulator training offered in clinical settings improves endoscopy skills. The possibility of using a computer-based simulator to improve endoscopy skills is growing.
CD008250,There is some indication that a Tai chi Qigong program may be beneficial for the health-related quality of life of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct large-scale randomised controlled trials on the topic.
CD008312,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of any interventions to improve adherence to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is a need for more studies of high methodological quality.
CD008320,There is no evidence that a specific anti-itch drug can be recommended for use in patients with renal itch. There is limited evidence that a specific anti-itch drug can be recommended for use in patients with chronic renal failure. There is limited evidence that a specific anti-itch drug can be recommended for use in patients with chronic renal failure.
CD008326,"Disc prosthesis may be as effective as anterior fusion in alleviating chronic pain in low back pain. However, there is limited evidence for improvement in long-term outcomes. In the event of a full-term outcome failure, the choice of whether to continue with rehabilitation or to have surgery is more likely to be the choice of choice. Short-term data are lacking in most studies. This may explain why there is limited evidence for improvement in long-term outcomes in studies comparing disc prosthesis with anterior fusion."
CD008366,"There is some evidence that exercise can be a useful tool for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. However, most of the studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the program in the era of antenatal steroid use and early intervention is indicated to be ineffective. Large-scale exercise programs are needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality."
CD008386,"Atorvastatin may be beneficial as add-on therapy to interferon beta-1a in people with RR-MS. In people with RR-MS, however, the beneficial effects appear to be limited. There is no evidence that the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin are diminished by taking it as a standalone therapy. In people with RR-MS, the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin appear to be limited. There is no evidence that the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin are diminished by taking it as a standalone therapy."
CD008392,"There is evidence that ibuprofen, when taken pre-operatively, reduces pain associated with orthodontic separator placement. This finding may justify the use of ibuprofen for pain relief in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. There is no evidence that ibuprofen is superior to placebo in alleviating pain associated with orthodontic separator placement."
CD008407,"The analgesic effects of ibuprofen for pain following episiotomy are unclear. One trial found significant benefit from the drug in the morning, while another found significant benefit from the drug in the evening. There is no evidence that the painkillers differ according to the type of pain or the length of the procedure."
CD008408,There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with infants to significantly reduce pain response during routine immunization procedures. One intervention that can be used with infants to significantly reduce pain response is the use of a non-pharmacological solution for the pain assessment.
CD008444,"There is evidence that in the initial hospitalisation of acute ischemic stroke patients, clinicians are more likely to recommend routine medication and intensive care. Patients are more likely to be discharged with minimal complications if they are admitted to a stroke care monitoring unit. However, there is no evidence that this is the case for all patients. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required to determine the effectiveness of different stroke monitoring units and to define the optimal arrangement of these units."
CD008445,"There is evidence that mild hypothermia can be offered to patients undergoing craniotomy for aneurysm. This treatment is effective in reducing the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular complications, and in decreasing the incidence of death. This treatment is effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and in decreasing the risk of postoperative bacteremia. However, there is no evidence that this treatment is effective in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and in decreasing the risk of neurologic deficits. These data do not support the use of any interventions to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and in decreasing the risk of post"
CD008502,"We found some limited evidence of benefit from the use of oral GABAB agonists in the treatment of acute symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. However, most of the data were not of high methodological quality and further research is needed."
CD008538,Sargramostim appears to be beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease. There is no evidence of effect on CDAI in patients treated with sargramostim.
CD008562,"There is evidence that human-administered activated protein C (APC) may be effective for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with acute leukemia. The results suggest that APC may be more effective than heparin, without increasing bleeding. There is no evidence that the effects of activated protein C on platelet count, thrombin time or thrombin time are superior to those of heparin. These results suggest that the use of human-administered activated protein C in the treatment of DIC is justified."
CD008600,"There is evidence that in the US, antithrombotic therapy is more effective than no therapy at reducing venous thromboembolic events (VTA) in patients with older patients receiving OAT. However, the evidence is not robust and there is a requirement for more studies of high methodological quality."
CD008635,"The two regimens of cord-cleansing included in this review provide evidence that in a setting where cord separation is important, chlorhexidine cleansing may be more effective than salicylic sugar powder. However, the choice of whether to use chlorhexidine as a primary treatment and whether it is better than salicylic sugar powder may have adverse effects on the quality of life of preterm infants. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of the two regimens of cord-cleansing included in this review and to determine whether it is better than no cord-cleansing or not."
CD008686,There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine routine x-ray examination of patients with acute low back pain in primary care. The findings suggest that clinicians should be more cautious in their initial diagnosis of patients with acute low back pain. Patients with acute low back pain should be offered a choice of routine x-ray or a more invasive clinical examination.
CD008691,There is evidence that DSE is effective in detecting coronary artery disease in patients undergoing renal transplantation. This finding is based on a small sample of patients who underwent DSE in the lead up to renal transplantation. No evidence was found that CA was effective in detecting coronary artery disease.
CD008739,There is evidence that topical antiseptics are effective for preventing vaginal candidiasis in women with HIV. One study found that weekly tablets of clotrimazole (200 mg) are effective in preventing oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis. Another study found that weekly tablets of clotrimazole (200 mg) are effective in preventing esophageal candidiasis. The risk of death from vaginal candidiasis in women with HIV is unknown. There is evidence that antiseptics are effective for preventing
CD008896,"Although CBD has been used in some form in Iran, evidence from small studies and randomised controlled trials does not suggest a significant effect on contraceptive usage or use of CBD in remote areas of the country. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed controlled trials on the effectiveness of CBD in improving contraceptive usage and use in remote areas of Iran."
CD008914,"There is evidence that stenting the pancreatic duct is effective in reducing the incidence of pancreatic fistulas following pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, there is no evidence that stenting the pancreatic duct is effective in reducing the length of postoperative hospital stay or mortality."
CD008933,"We are unable to give any clear recommendations for the use of natalizumab as a maintenance treatment for RR-MS. The beneficial effects of natalizumab for RR-MS remain inconclusive because of the high attrition bias, the small number of participants and the short follow-up. However, short-term treatment with a single dose of natalizumab resulted to be safe for most patients with RR-MS. Short-term treatment with a single dose of natalizumab resulted to be safe for most patients with RR-MS."
CD008987,There is inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of radial head replacement with metal prostheses in the treatment of displaced radial head fractures. Patients with radial head fractures treated with metal prostheses achieved statistically significant better clinical results than those treated with non-metal prostheses. The incidence of complication is 3.7% less in the polylactide group than in the control group.
CD009046,There is evidence that texting information to help people quit smoking is effective in reducing smoking rates in indigenous people. This could be because the messages are short and easy to understand. There is no evidence that the messages are more effective than drugs such as pessaries or antidepressants. There is no evidence that the messages are more effective than drugs such as pessaries or antidepressants.
CD009058,There is evidence that cryosurgery is effective in the treatment of tumour reduction and survival in patients with metastatic liver metastases. The rate of death is significantly higher in the first group of patients than in the second group. This is based on medium-term evidence. No evidence is available regarding the effectiveness of cryo-assisted resection of hepatic metastases.
CD009062,There is evidence that hypnosis can be used as an adjunct to childbirth education to significantly manage pain during labour and in the aftermath of childbirth. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of assessment.
CD009107,"There is evidence that water can be used as a treatment for pain in labour. In a randomised controlled trial of appropriate size, women in three different countries were given choice of four inflatable water blocks each. The results showed a significant reduction in pain scores after water blocks were given, although results were not significant for ages or gender. The evidence is inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of water as a treatment for pain in labour."
CD009131,"We found some limited evidence of effects of cognitive training on outcomes in people with MS. The results suggest that cognitive training may be beneficial for people with MS in terms of improved neurological status, fatigue and quality of life."
CD009189,We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. The effectiveness and value of interventions for improving the quality of life of people with HIV are unclear.
CD009209,There is evidence that exercise can be used as a tool to reduce weight. Most of the studies were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy and effectiveness of the intervention in the era of antenatal steroid use and early use of exercise-related drugs is indicated. There is no evidence that exercise can be used as a tool to reduce weight.
CD009215,There is some indication that aromatherapy may be a useful intervention for pain management during labour. This conclusion is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of outcome measures.
CD009217,There is evidence that dietary changes can reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension. This finding is limited by small study sizes and lack of standardisation in the choice of intervention.
CD009337,"There is evidence that social media campaigns can increase exposure to HIV testing information, increase knowledge about syphilis, increase exposure to pornography and reduce risky sexual practices. However, there is insufficient evidence that these campaigns can reduce syphilis infections. We recommend that social media campaigns providing information about HIV testing be more carefully designed and that campaigns providing more information about testing are more carefully designed."
CD009401,"There is evidence that knowledge brokering is effective in increasing the use of research evidence in the formulation of public health policies and programs. However, there is no evidence that the use of knowledge brokering is effective in increasing the use of research evidence in the formulation of public health policies and programs. The effectiveness of knowledge brokering may be improved with the development of a more robust online registry of research evidence."
CD009411,"Autologous haemopoietic stem cells (BEAM) are effective in treating patients with Hodgkin's disease but are associated with more adverse effects and do not improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed HL. In the absence of evidence from randomized controlled trials, patients with Hodgkin's disease are advised to continue with standard chemotherapy until further evidence is available. However, in the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial."
CD009414,"Interventions to reduce the risk of intimate partner violence being repeated are growing. One of the most effective interventions was a screening program for women at risk for intimate partner violence. It resulted in a 10% reduction in the frequency of episodes of intimate partner violence, which was small compared to other interventions. Another significant result was a 10% reduction in the frequency of postpartum violence. This intervention was not statistically significant compared to other interventions."
CD009497,"There is evidence that certain drugs can prolong survival in patients with advanced colonic cancer. One such drug is allopurinol. This drug appears to be effective in preventing the free radicals that cause cancer. However, there is no evidence that this drug can reduce mortality. There is no evidence that this drug can reduce the risk of all-cause mortality."
CD009510,There is evidence that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab for the treatment of macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion are effective. The results suggest that the drug may be effective in preventing the progressive loss of visual clarity in patients with macular edema following BRVO. The data suggest that the drug may be effective in preventing the progressive loss of visual clarity in patients with macular edema following BRVO.
CD009607,There is some indication that exercise may be beneficial for children with asthma. Most of the available studies are not of high methodological quality and further research is needed.
CD009662,"The use of a guidewire-guided cannulation technique for the cannulation of the common bile duct is associated with a lower rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis and may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. However, the results of studies regarding the usefulness of WGC are conflicting. A single-center, blinded trial of conventional cannulation technique using sphinctertome and contrast injection versus guidewire cannulation technique is needed to determine whether this reduces the rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis."
CD009779,"Early endoscopic intervention, especially in the early stages of pancreatitis, is possible to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and hospital stay in patients with acute pancreatitis who are undergoing EI. This update of the review does not contain any new trials published in full."
CD009882,"Teriflunomide appears to be a safe and effective add-on therapy to interferon-β in patients with RRMS. Its effects on disease activity and relapse rate are consistent with previous evidence. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both. This review has not examined economic data."
CD010119,There is evidence that progressive use of interventions to increase contraceptive uptake and contraceptive use among women in HIV-1-serodiscordant partnerships are effective in reducing the incidence of pregnancy and in decreasing the risk of HIV infection. progressive use of interventions to increase contraceptive uptake and in decreasing the risk of HIV infection and in decreasing the risk of pregnancy are effective in reducing the incidence of both HIV and contraception.
CD010155,"We can conclude no implications for practice at this stage. tinzaparin appears to be effective in reducing painful crisis of sickle cell anemia. In patients with acute painful crisis of SCA, tinzaparin appears to be effective in reducing the duration of painful crisis and in reducing the incidence of bleeding. This update of the review provides additional data to support the current evidence."
CD010245,"Tranexamic acid may be useful for reducing erythrocyte transfusion in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. However, there is insufficient evidence from this study's safety data and further research is required. This treatment may be more effective than saline at reducing erythrocyte transfusion but may be more harmful than tranexamic acid in increasing the risk of vascular events. Further trials are needed to determine if the benefits of tranexamic acid are truly substantial and if so, at what dose and in which clinical setting."
CD010424,"There is evidence that peritoneal closure is effective in reducing pain and in reducing the risk of hernia after abdominal surgery. However, there is no evidence that it is effective in reducing the risk of abdominal pain and in reducing the risk of hernia after abdominal surgery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct randomized controlled trials on the incision used in abdominal surgery."
CD010609,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of antiepileptic drugs for the prophylactic treatment of migraine. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness and safety of gabapentin in the prophylaxis of migraine."
