CD001263,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of cefoperazone/sulbactam as a treatment for severe melioidosis. In the absence of evidence to support the use of any specific antibiotic for this treatment, this review was unable to recommend a specific drug for its use in this situation. However, it should be recognised that the current evidence base is limited due to the small number of participants in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless, the results suggest that cefoperazone/sulbact"
CD001281,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of theophylline as a therapy for nocturnal asthma. In patients with moderate and moderate nocturnal asthma where symptoms are noticably more severe, early morning awakenings and limited use of salbutamol may be important.

CD001401,"We found a similar effect for all CPT regimens when used in patients with cystic fibrosis but no significant difference for the use of CPT alone. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop CPT regimens that might make it more effective to remove mucus from the lungs in patients with cystic fibrosis."
CD001466,"There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the value of somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials in the evaluation and prediction of the effect of therapy in spondylotic cervical myelopathy. Patients with mild and moderate myelopathy were randomized into groups that underwent either surgical or conservative therapy, and there was no significant difference between groups. There was a small improvement in clinical and evoked potential parameters after surgery in the mild myelopathy group, although this was not statistically significant. In a subgroup of patients, the isolated segmental medullar N13 abnormality could potentially predict favorable postsurgical clinical outcome. Longitudinal"

There is no evidence of benefit in overall survival in patients with displaced subcapital femoral fracture from the two studies published in 2005."
CD001708,"There is no high quality evidence that internal fixation is superior to hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty, and there is a small number of patients who did not respond to treatment. There is no evidence that the risk of death or need for operative intervention is increased following internal fixation, and there is no evidence that the risk of limb or hip fracture may be improved following this treatment."
CD001717,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of perphenazin-enanthate as a treatment for schizophrenia. When used in patients with chronic schizophrenia it is possible that the drug may have some adverse effects.

[Note: The 26 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]"
CD002011,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of any specific type of physiotherapy for cystic fibrosis. The use of a positive expiratory pressure mask (PEP) appears to be effective for improving pulmonary function in patients with CF. It should be recognised that, due to the poor quality of the trials, conclusions should be drawn with caution."
CD002038,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of zidovudine for patients with HIV-1 who are not already receiving antiretroviral treatment, and some evidence to support the use of the drug in combination with other antiretroviral therapies. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of zidovudine for patients with advanced HIV who are not already receiving antiretroviral treatment, and who are experiencing high attrition. The evidence to date may justify the development and evaluation of existing HIV therapy programs incorporating combination regimens."
CD002058,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of systemic dexamethasone for preterm infants with RDS and at risk for chronic lung disease (CLD). In the absence of evidence to support more intensive use of dexamethasone, this review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest form of treatment possible."

CD002238,"The results of the review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression. Imipramine and oxybutynin are highly effective in the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs in the treatment of secondary nocturnal enuresis. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of imipramine and oxybutynin."
CD002248,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of relaxation training for dysmenorrhea. In comparisons with placebo, relaxation training appeared to reduce the frequency of periods of discomfort, pain, and time lost due to dysmenorrheic symptoms. However, there was no significant difference between relaxation and no treatment or interaction. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from good-quality, contemporary trials is required to determine the effectiveness of relaxation training for dysmenorrhea compared to other treatments such as antidepressants or pain management training."
CD002256,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of cefuroxime in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy.

The use of any specific type of hormonal contraceptive for male contraception is necessary. In the absence of evidence to support more invasive or more technically difficult methods, the review authors recommend the least invasive and simplest method available, which is to use a small number of small and easily available implants. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of these implants and the optimal doses and regimens and to examine new contraceptive methods."

CD004389,"There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific regimens for prevention of relapse of vivax malaria in patients with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria. The current evidence base is limited due to the small number of patients included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the regimens or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop regimens for prevention of relapse of vivax malaria in patients with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria that are not overly stratified."
CD004402,"The limited number and small sample size of the included RCTs restricts the confidence that can be attributed to these results. Adequately powered RCTs evaluating the benefit of oral dexamethasone compared to placebo are needed, particularly for patients with acute exudative pharyngitis associated with infectious mononucleosis. The low mortality from infectious mononucleosis and the short-lived relief of pain in children with sore throat may make dexamethasone an effective treatment for such patients. However, high mortality from infectious mononucleosis and the long-term effects of dexamethasone alone are"
CD004408,"There is no evidence to suggest that involuntary outpatient commitment reduces hospital admissions or length of hospital stay in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is possible that this could be because of the high attrition bias, the lack of information about the effectiveness of this program and the small number of participants in the study. However, it seems likely that there is no reduction in hospital admissions or length of hospital stay when people are offered outpatient treatment."

CD004631,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of trapeziectomy for basal joint resection or for the use of any other type of tendon reconstruction in this treatment. The use of any other type of tendon reconstruction is associated with a higher risk of synovitis, which may explain why there is limited evidence to support the use of any other type of tendon reconstruction in this treatment. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of trapeziectomy for basal joint resection and for the maintenance of joint space after arthroplasty."

CD006063,"We found no clear evidence regarding the effect of rosiglitazone compared to either metformin or rosiglitazone alone, and no clear evidence comparing either to oral antidiabetic drugs alone. There is limited evidence from comparisons of oral antidiabetic drugs with other antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin or rosiglitazone, because these drugs are used for intra-abdominal administration and may alter the participants' lipid profile. Further trials should clarify the adverse effects of rosiglitazone on lipid profile, assess the optimal dose and frequency of administration of the drug,"
CD006073,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of any interventions for improving functional ability of people with acute stroke after they have been treated for physiotherapy. One intervention that may have been useful for improving functional ability of people with acute stroke was the Bon Saint Côme device, which may have improved muscle strength and may have improved muscle strength in the affected lower extremities. However, there was no evidence from the trials on the quality of life or the number of people who were able to return to work after stroke."

Varenicline, a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, may be beneficial for smoking cessation. In light of the modest number of studies included in the review, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine the effectiveness of this therapy in preventing smoking cessation in adults with mild to moderate COPD."
CD006105,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of metformin for fertility treatment in women with PCOS. It is possible that the beneficial effects of metformin for fertility may be limited due to the high toxicity of the drug and the small number of women included in the study. However, it is not clear that the lack of beneficial effects of metformin for fertility would be a major issue in the treatment of PCOS. In view of the modest number of women included in the study, it is not clear that the metformin results will have a significant effect on fertility."

In the RA shoulders, good surface replacement resulted in a higher mean score than uncemented humeral stem replacement. However, all studies were of unclear methodological quality and small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed."
CD006201,"Current evidence does not demonstrate a mortality benefit from oral melarsoprol compared to other regimens, but there is a risk of severe adverse events with the new regimen. In patients with second-stage Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, treatment with a single dose is effective, with little to no side effects. The risk of severe adverse events is higher with the new regimen, although this is not clear from the data. Adverse events were generally minor and transient, and transient events were less likely with the new regimen than with the existing regimens. The risk of major bleeding was similar to placebo, although this is"

CD006225,"There is no evidence of effect of catheters on pregnancy and cumulative IUI rates in women with infertility. One trial found a higher rate of regurgitation when used with a Gynetics catheter than with a Makler cannula. This could be because the Gynetics catheter is more effective in terms of lower frequency of regurgitation and lower incidence of bleeding. However, there was no evidence of effect of catheters on IUI rates or of fertility in women with infertility."
CD006244,"The use of primary health care personnel to identify cases of epilepsy and initiate simple treatment protocols is effective in terms of reducing medication use and improving patient satisfaction.

However, the findings of the review and review of the intervention's effects on incidence and compliance were significant."
CD006569,"Olanzapine and aripiprazole appear to be similar in effectiveness and safety when used in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes.

CD007815,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of quetiapine for patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia who are hospitalised with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In these patients, quetiapine appears to be similar to haloperidol in terms of efficacy and tolerability, but there is a higher risk of extrapyramidal events and side effects. In patients with schizophrenia where quetiapine is associated with a lower incidence of psychosis and adverse events than haloperidol, there is no clear evidence of a difference in the rate of improvement of symptoms or of improvement in adverse events"

They can be used in conjunction with other aligning materials to produce a more effective and effective solution. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution until further corroborative evidence is established.
CD007877,"There is insufficient evidence to support the routine administration of rFVIIa in the treatment of patients with TBI/polytrauma. It is possible that the beneficial effects of rFVIIa may be limited by the small number of participants included in the study, the small number of participants receiving rFVIIa, the small number of participants receiving baseline rFVIIa, or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. The aim of this review was to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of rFVIIa in the treatment of patients with TBI/polytrauma."
CD007921,"There is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or effectiveness of the use of a vein collar for PTFE bypass in femoro-infrapopliteal bypass or for any other type of bypass graft in ischaemia. The use of a vein collar may be useful for preventing the use of PCI in these cases, but there is insufficient evidence to support or not support the use of a vein collar for these purposes. Further randomised trials are needed to confirm the results of this review and to define the optimal use of a vein collar for PTFE bypass in ischaemia."
CD007954,"There is insufficient evidence to assess the value of psychostimulant treatment for depression in primary care. In most comparisons, the participants were not given more than a few doses of psychostimulant and were not shown to be at risk of serious adverse effects.

The results suggest that the pain relief effects of ibuprofen are modest compared to those of acetaminophen or paracetamol, but are significantly more effective than either of these drugs at the first hour. These results do not apply to absence or myoclonus, which are not clear effects of ibuprofen in post-partum pain. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this study and to define the"
CD008408,"We found no evidence for analgesic effects of sucrose on pain responses in infants during immunization, although it was possible that this could be because of the lack of a non-nutritive taste that would have been associated with higher pain scores.
