In the second trial patients with chronic lung disease were included in the intervention, a sample size of large. In"
CD000187,"Oral anticoagulation may be useful in the treatment of NRAF patients with atrial fibrillation who are wishing to preserve their liberty from anticoagulation. However, many of the trials were done in the 1970s and 1980s and re-evaluation of the strategy of oral anticoagulation in the era of antenatal anticoagulation is indicated focusing on administration methods."
CD000201,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from the use of oxytocin alone in the management of the third stage of labour. However, a multicenter randomized controlled trial of appropriate size is justified to determine the effects of different doses of oxytocin on the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage and the use of oxytocin alone in this situation."

CD000353,There is some indication that adjunctive homeopathic remedies may have some small benefits in the treatment of asthma in children.
CD000361,"The use of intravenous immune globulin for prevention of sepsis in preterm infants is not effective, and causes an increase in the incidence of sepsis, which may, theoretically, have implications in the treatment of preterm infants.

CD000498,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of streptokinase for the treatment of post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilation in preterm infants. The beneficial effects of streptokinase for the treatment of post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilation are not clear due to the high attrition bias, the small number of participants and the short follow-up. However, it is clear from the literature that the potential benefits of streptokinase for the treatment of post-"

CD001054,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of health visitors for people with visual impairment. The evidence is limited due to the small number of participants in the trials, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes.

CD001158,"Prednisone appears to be a beneficial treatment for RA in the elderly. However, there is insufficient information about the effectiveness of prednisone compared to other second-line drugs and the balance between efficacy and toxicity, including the effect on bone mass, has not been investigated in long-term studies.

CD001829,"We found no clear evidence to support the use of vitamin A for the treatment of oral leukoplakia. The results suggest that it may be possible to use vitamin A as a adjunct to oral leukoplakia. The use of vitamin A for the treatment of oral leukoplakia is not effective due to the high toxicity of the gel, which may make it difficult to safely administrate. Further trials are needed to confirm the results of this study and to define the optimal dose and frequency of administration of vitamin A."

CD003161,There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of different cognitive-behavioral therapies for sleep-maintenance insomnia in comparison to drug therapy or other interventions. This review provides some evidence to show that the combined effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral and pharmacological approaches to sleep-maintenance insomnia is not significantly different from the individual approaches. The findings suggest that sleep-maintenance insomnia may be more difficult to treat than sleep-onset problems.
CD003175,There is no evidence to suggest that sequential chemotherapy reduces total mortality or overall survival in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. This conclusion is based on medium-term evidence from two randomised controlled trials. No outright evidence was found.

In the patients with CIN II/III, vitamin A is associated with a lower response rate"
CD003303,There is no convincing evidence to support the use of optical erythromycin HMDs for people with peripheral vision.

CD003452,"Early treatment of children with early permanent dentition for lower incisor proclination does not appear to be effective, despite small reductions in the number of treated children and the frequency of treatment. The small change in the skeletal relationship might not be considered clinically significant.

CD003656,"There is no convincing evidence to support the use of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hypertension in people with borderline hypertension. The evidence is limited due to the small number of participants included in the trials, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes.

Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review and to define the optimal cream selection."
CD004249,"Although the effectiveness of mobilization and manipulation of the cervical spine has been well documented, the small inherent risks associated with these techniques has led clinicians to frequently utilize manipulation directed at the thoracic spine in this patient population.

CD004680,"There is no evidence to suggest that the use of Tenckhoff catheters is superior to the use of laparoscopic catheters, or any other method, for the purpose of catheter use in CAPD. The data do not support the continued use of laparoscopic catheters in the context of CAPD. However, it is possible that it could be used in the context of CAPD.
