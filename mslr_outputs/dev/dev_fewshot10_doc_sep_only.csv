CD000165,"We have not found evidence that a reduction in cancer mortality or respiratory disturbances is significantly affected by the use of tobacco cessation in people with diabetes. However, this could be because the intervention was more effective than other methods in the trials. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from larger and longer-term trials is required in order to assess the effectiveness of intervention in people with diabetes."

CD001327,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from prophylactic antibiotics prior to IUD insertion, but does suggest a reduction in the risk for pelvic infection following IUD insertion. This is based on a small number of studies. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from larger and longer-term trials is required to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing PID and other pelvic diseases associated with IUD insertion."
CD001333,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from the administration of naltrexone to opioid-dependent people. No evidence was found comparing naltrexone to placebo in the two studies.

CD001746,We have not found evidence that a reduction in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke reduces child smoking and child consumption of tobacco.
CD001777,There is little evidence to suggest that a mortality benefit exists from the insertion of IUDs into pregnant women after abortion. The results suggest that the rates of expulsion and/or displacement from IUD insertion are lower for women with larger uteri who often experience higher rates of pregnancy. The lower event rates for Lippes and copper -bearing Lippes Loop suggest that the benefits of IUD insertion may be more concentrated in the larger women with larger uteri.
CD001829,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from oral leukoplakia when treated with topical vitamin A. The results suggest that topical treatments may be effective in reducing the number of spinous cells in affected areas.
CD001843,"We have not found evidence that a reduction in urinary incontinence is effected by the use of pelvic floor muscle exercises during pelvic floor muscle therapy. The results suggest that pelvic floor muscle exercises may improve continence in affected areas. However, this is based on a small sample of studies."
CD001863,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of postnatal contraceptive counseling in preventing second pregnancies. The results suggest that a more effective intervention could have been applied to the larger groups of women in the study.
CD001867,"We have not found evidence that a significant benefit exists from the use of Naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence. While evidence is lacking, this could be because the trials involved in the trials were small and the results were heavily underpowered to detect clinically relevant differences between naltrexone and placebo."
CD001871,We have not found evidence that a reduction in body mass index is associated with physical activity in children.
CD001877,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of mammography on breast cancer mortality in the randomized trials of the two studies that have been published. The studies were underpowered to detect and report on any adverse effects that might result from the use of the hooked-wire technique. The results suggest that the benefits of mammography may be under-quoted in some cases. This could be because the trials were small and the results were under-quoted.
CD001888,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from autotransfusion of shed blood during cardiac surgery. The results suggest that the benefits of autotransfusion of shed blood may be under-investigated in larger numbers than in other studies.

Further evidence is required from larger and more contemporary trials.
CD001972,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between fluconazole and ketoconazole for the outcomes examined in this review. Results do not apply to absence or absence of studies.
CD002011,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between manual and chest physiotherapy for the outcomes examined in this review. Results suggest that the HFCC is effective in preventing and reducing respiratory disturbances in affected patients. However, it is possible that this could be because the machines are more easily accessible than other available treatments such as manual and epidural drainage. Further evidence is required to assess the effectiveness of the HFCC compared to other available treatments such as percussive ventilator or Expiratory Flow."
CD002038,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of combination therapy on HIV-infected patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or fewer than 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter.

Further evidence is required in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention of acupressure in larger and longer-term trials."
CD002248,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from relaxation training when compared with no intervention or control groups. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of pain management training in the context of dysmenorrhea."
CD002256,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral cefuroxime in preventing acute pyelonephritis in pregnant women. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes.

CD002771,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of Kangaroo mother care on very low birthweight infants. The results suggest that the benefits of kangaroo mother care may be more effective than other methods in reducing mortality in very low birthweight infants.
CD002778,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral splints in the treatment of people with myofascial pain of the jaw muscles. The results suggest that oral splints may improve pain in affected muscles but this is based on a small sample size and the absence of evidence.
CD002787,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The results suggest that inhaled NO may improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but does not improve hemodynamics.

CD002829,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of alpha-tocopherol on the survival of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS) and the ability to thrive. The results suggest that a disturbed oxidative/antioxidative balance may be involved in the progression of disease in affected muscle and muscle function.
CD002830,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of oral droperidol in the management of acutely agitated patients. The results suggest that droperidol may be effective in controlling acute agitation, but it may be more effective in the longer-term."
CD002863,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of propranolol on the outcomes of hypertension in women with moderate and severe hypertension. The results suggest that propranolol may improve fetal outcomes but that this may be due to a reduction in the number of relevant laboratory tests.
CD002900,Current evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from the use of manual aspiration in the first trimester of abortion. This is based on a small sample size and the absence of other relevant studies.
CD002918,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between percutaneous radiofrequency lumbar sympathectomy and lumbar sympathetic neurolysis for the outcomes examined in this review.
CD002923,"We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between penfluridol and chlorpromazine for the outcomes examined in this review.

CD003064,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of oral furosemide on the clinical course of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. The results suggest that oral furosemide does not improve the clinical course of TTN.
CD003076,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of patients with proximal deep-vein thrombosis with heparin. The results suggest that a fixed-dose heparin may be effective in preventing and reducing bleeding in these patients. However, a true benefit could easily have been missed with the small sample sizes in the two eligible studies."
CD003078,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of peritonitis in patients with CAPD while using the CAPD systems. The results suggest that the systems may reduce the infection rates of affected patients. However, this is based on a small sample size and the absence of other evidence.

CD003153,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of Cycloserine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Higher doses may be necessary to achieve efficacy in the AD population and do not appear to be precluded by the adverse event profile seen in this study.
CD003161,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from the use of cognitive-behavior therapy in people with late-life insomnia. Results suggest that the benefits of sleep compression may be more effective than drug therapy in reducing sleep and waking up after sleep onset and sleep efficiency.
CD003175,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. The results suggest that the benefits of radiotherapy may be more effective in these patients than adjuvant chemotherapy.

CD008739,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from oral fluconazole for HIV-infected women.
CD008896,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of contraceptive counseling on women in the postabortion period. The results suggest that the availability of contraception is effective in reducing unwanted pregnancy and encouraging women's use of contraception. However, this does not apply to the absence or absence of counseling."
CD008914,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from pancreatic fistula when placed with an stent. There is no clear evidence to suggest that a mortality benefit from pancreatic stenting could have been avoided or understated in the two eligible studies.
CD008933,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from the administration of interferon beta-1a in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). This is based on a small number of studies.
CD008987,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of polylactide pins for the treatment of radial head fractures. The results suggest that polylactide pins may improve outcomes in radial head fractures compared to metal implants for the treatment of these fractures.
CD009046,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of nicotine patches in reducing smoking in indigenous people when offered a brief intervention for cessation, and to assess changes in smoking behaviour at six months."
CD009058,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of cryosurgery in the treatment of liver metastases. The results suggest that cryogenic procedures may improve survival in affected patients.
CD009062,We have not found evidence that a reduction in pain was achieved by administering hypnotic analgesia to women in the highly susceptible groups or by administering epidural analgesia to those who were hypnotically treated.
CD009107,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sterile water in reducing pain during labour and the results suggest that the current method of administering sterile water may be effective in reducing pain during labour. However, this is based on a small sample size and the results are marred by inconsistencies."
CD009131,"We have not found evidence that cognitive training improves memory performance in people with multiple sclerosis. However, the results suggest that it may improve ability to remember information and to improve ability to learn and organize it."
CD009189,"There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone-delivered, interpersonal psychotherapy in reducing depressive symptoms and psychiatric distress in HIV-infected people with depression."
CD009209,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from the implementation of exercise intervention in white-collar workers.
CD009215,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of Aromatherapy on intrapartum outcomes. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence from larger trials is required to assess the effect of Aromatherapy on a wider range of outcomes than was examined in this review.
CD009217,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from reduction in sodium intake or reduction in blood pressure in people with high-normal BP.
CD009337,We have found no evidence that a significant increase in HIV infection rates was achieved by the promotion of social media messaging about HIV testing and the associated risk factors during and after the test.
CD009401,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of educational visits on obstetric practices when they are used in conjunction with evidence-based guidance. The results suggest that effective education is more effective than instruction in order to encourage the use of post-natal encouraged clinical practices when it comes to the use of encouraged
CD009411,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from high-dose chemotherapy in patients with Hodgkin's disease while increasing the risk for adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting.
CD009414,"Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from intervention in pregnant women at risk for or in abusive relationships. However, this does not exclude the possible usefulness of nursing care management during pregnancy and postpartum."
CD009497,Existing evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from the use of oxygen-derived free radicals in colonic cancer.
CD009510,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of intravitreal ranibizumab on patients with macular edema after branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The results suggest that ranibizumab may improve visual acuity in patients with macular edema after BRVO but not to the extent of that in the 2 ranibizumab groups.
CD009607,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effect of swimming on symptoms and exercise induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children with asthma when compared with asthmatic controls who did not undergo swim training.
CD009662,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of selective cannulation of the bile duct for the reduction of post-ERCP pancreatitis compared to no intervention or no intervention at all. The results suggest that the benefits of selective cannulation may be more effective than other methods in reducing pancreatitis in the majority of people with pancreatitis but that a true benefit may el
CD009779,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic intervention in the treatment of patients with acute biliary pancreatitis. The results suggest that the benefits of ERCP may be more easily appreciated in the early stages of the disease than in later-stage procedures.
CD009882,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from oral teriflunomide as add-on therapy to existing stable-dosed patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). The results suggest that the benefits of oral teriflunomide may be more easily ignored in such cases as when the drug is administered in a low-dose.
CD010119,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit has been achieved from the introduction of HIV testing into family planning services.
CD010155,Reduction of pain intensity and duration of painful crisis was achieved in treated patients with acute sickle cell anemia (SCA).
CD010245,There is inadequate evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing blood transfusion after hip fracture surgery. The current evidence base is limited due to the differing methodologies employed in the trials and inconsistencies in reporting of outcomes. Further evidence is required in order to assess the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss after hip fracture surgery.
CD010424,We have not found evidence that a significant difference exists between the two methods of closure of abdominal wounds when it comes to the outcomes of the studies. No outright evidence was found to support or overthrow current treatment policies.
CD010609,We have not found evidence that a mortality benefit exists from the use of prophylactic drug in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Results suggest that the benefits of gabapentin may be more easily missed in the absence of evidence.
